</div>

<p>In the year 1809, Mr. Matthew Montagu published
the first two of four volumes of letters of his aunt,
Elizabeth Montagu. He was not only her nephew,
he was also her adopted son and her executor. On
the 5th of December in that year, the celebrated
statesman, William Windham, was reading those volumes,
“in the evening, up-stairs;” and he subsequently
recorded the following judgment of them in
his diary: “I think very highly of them. One of
their chief merits is <i>series juncturaque</i>. Nothing can
be more easy and natural than the manner in which
the thoughts rise one out of the other, even where the
thoughts may appear rather forced, nor is the expression
ever hard or laboured. I see but little to object
to in the thoughts themselves, but nothing can be
more natural or graceful than the manner in which
they are put together. The flow of her style is not
less natural, because it is fully charged with shining
particles, and sparkles as it flows.”</p>

<p>In 1813, Mr. Matthew Montagu published two more
volumes of his aunt’s correspondence. The press
generally received them with pleasant testimony of
approval. It not only endorsed the judgment of the
eminent statesman quoted above, but it especially
pointed out that the letters were genuine and authentic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
which could not be said of a similar collection of
letters then challenging the censure of the town.
Mrs. Montagu’s letters were read with great avidity,
and readers for the most part came to the same conclusion
as the statesman and the critics.</p>

<p>The last letter in the series is addressed to
Mrs. Elizabeth Carter. The date is September,
1761. The writer lived nearly forty years after that
date. During that time, she maintained a lively correspondence;
her letters were copied and circulated.
After her death, a few, with fragments of others,
found their way into various periodicals. The correspondence
which Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu kept up
with her sister-in-law, Mrs. Robinson, wife of the Rev.
William Robinson, and a few other friends, between
1761 and the close of the last century, was long in the
possession of the late Mr. Richard Bentley, who purchased
them at a sale of autographs. These form the
chief portion of the present volume.</p>

<p>In a note to the letters published by Mr. Montagu,
the editor states that they are “intended to convey
in them the biography of the writer, which the editor
thinks he could not so well exemplify by any remarks
of his own as by the letters themselves.” Mr. Montagu
gave to his aunt’s readers every word of every
epistle, from the salutation to the signature.</p>

<p>From the letters now printed for the first time
there have only been omitted vain repetitions, formal
compliments, and the nothings that may have once
been somethings, but which are now mere dust and
ashes, from which little of value is to be sifted. There
have been retained all that could further “convey the
biography of the writer,” with addition of such anecdotal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
illustration from the printed letters and from contemporary
records as might serve to show more
completely the character and surroundings of a Lady
of the Last Century.</p>

</div>

<p>Elizabeth Robinson, who became so well known,
subsequently, as Mrs. Montagu, belongs altogether to
the eighteenth century. She was born at York, in
October, 1720. She died in the last year of that
century, 1800. Miss Robinson was of a family, the
founder of which, William Robinson, a London merchant,
but a descendant of a line of Scottish barons,
bought, in 1610, the estate of Rokeby, in Yorkshire,
from Sir Thomas Rokeby, whose ancestors had held
it from the time of the Conquest. Her father,
Matthew Robinson, was an only son of a cadet
branch of the Robinsons. He was a member of the
University of Cambridge, where he wooed the Muses
less ardently than he did Miss Elizabeth Drake, a
beautiful heiress, whom he married when he was only
eighteen years of age. The very young couple
settled at Edgeley, in Yorkshire; but the husband
(owner, through his wife, of more than one estate in
the country) preferred the shady side of Pall Mall to
fields of waving corn or groves vocal with nightingales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>Of the twelve children of this marriage, seven sons
and two daughters survived their youth. The daughters,
Elizabeth and Sarah, were endowed with the
same literary tastes. Sarah wrote the more books,
but Elizabeth is the better remembered. The church,
the law, politics, and commerce attracted one or other
of the sons.</p>

<p>In 1730, the head of the elder branch of the Robinsons,
Thomas, was created a baronet. He was
that famous Long Tom Robinson of whom so many
well-known stories are told. Chesterfield slightly
touched him in an epigram, and Walpole seldom
referred to him without a sarcasm. At the coronation
of George the Third, Sir Thomas was mock
Duke of Normandy, who, with an equally English
and mock Duke of Aquitaine, was supposed to indicate
that the King of England was as much King of
France, by the grace of God, as he pretended to be.
Long Sir Thomas was so truly an Englishman that
he went to France, and into French society, in his
hunting-suit. A satirical French abbé, hearing his
name and looking at his marvellous attire, gravely
asked him if he were Robinson Crusoe.</p>

<p>Long Sir Thomas Robinson sold Rokeby to the
Morritts in 1769. When he died, in 1777, his title
went to his next surviving brother, Richard. This
Richard was an English clergyman, who, in 1731, had
commenced a successful career in Ireland, as chaplain
to two viceroys, and he was successively Bishop of
Killala, of Leighlin and Ferns, and of Kildare.
Finally, he was raised to the dignity of Archbishop of
Armagh, primate of Ireland. In the year that Sir
Thomas died, Richard was created an Irish peer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Baron Rokeby of Armagh, with remainder to Mrs.
Montagu’s father, Matthew Robinson. The father
did not live to succeed to the title, but his son
Matthew did. The present Lord Rokeby is Mrs.
Montagu’s great grandnephew, and was born when
she was yet living, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1798. The first lord figures
largely in this lady’s letters. His good works made
him popular in Ireland, which his Grace found to be a
fine country to live out of, as much as was, more or
less, consistent with duty. He was one of the best-known
characters at Bath during successive seasons;
he also suffered much from the gout; but he endured
with alacrity all the port and claret that were necessary
to keep it out of his archiepiscopal stomach.</p>

<p>Thus much for Mrs. Montagu’s family. She derived
from it a certain distinction; but she enjoyed
greater advantage, for a time at least, from the marriage
of her maternal grandmother, who took for her
second husband the learned and celebrated Dr. Conyers
Middleton. Doctor Middleton’s home was at
Cambridge, where a few of Miss Robinson’s youthful
years were profitably and curiously spent.</p>

<p>Curiously—from the method which the biographer
of Cicero took with the bright and intelligent girl.
Among the divines, scholars, philosophers, travellers,
men of the world who were, together or in turn, to
be met with at Doctor Middleton’s house, the figure
of the silent, listening, and observant little maid was
always to be seen. Her presence there was a part
of her education. Doctor Middleton trained her to
give perfect attention to the conversation, and to
repeat to him all that she could retain of it, after the
company had dispersed. When she had to speak of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
what she did not well understand, Doctor Middleton
enlightened his little pupil. This process not only
filled her young mind with knowledge, but made her
eager in the pursuit of more.</p>

<p>How readily she received impressions at an early
age, and how indelibly they were stamped on her
memory, she has herself recorded. “One of the strongest
pictures in my mind,” she wrote to Lord Lyttelton,
in 1759, “is the funeral of a Dean of York, which
I saw performed with great solemnity in the cathedral,
when I was about four years old. Whether the
memory of it, added to the present objects, may not
have made the place appear the more awful to me, I
do not know; but I was never so affected by any
edifice.” She loved York, and in her early Yorkshire
home the plan of education went far in advance of
the views, and perhaps of the powers, of family
governesses. Masters, as well as mistresses, were
there for the instruction of both sons and daughters;
but Elizabeth’s father sharpened and stimulated her
intellect by encouraging her to make smart repartees
to his own witty or severe judgments. In this cudgelling
of brains Matthew had great delight till he found
that his daughter was too much for him at his most
favourite weapons. Matthew then bit his lips, and
ceased to offer challenge or give provocation.</p>

<p>Matthew Robinson’s wife seems to have been
educated according to the traditions of a school
founded in 1673 for the purpose of raising women to
the dignity and usefulness which distinguished their
ancestresses. The lady, Mrs. Makin, who originated
this school for English maidens, stated her object in
an essay, of which a few words may be said, as illustrative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of a system of female education in England
which, founded nearly half a century before Elizabeth
Robinson was born, had not lost all its influence till
after she herself was to be reckoned among learned
young ladies. The work in question was called “An
Essay to revive the Ancient Education of Gentlewomen
in Religion, Manners, Arts, and Tongues:
With an Answer to the Objections against this way
of Education.” In the dedication to the Lady Mary,
daughter of James, Duke of York, the author says:
“The barbarous custom to breed women low is
grown general amongst us, and hath prevailed so far,
that it is verily believed that women are not endowed
with such reason as man.” Of old, Mrs. Makin says,
women were highly educated; but now, “not only
learning, but virtue itself, is scorned and neglected as
pedantic things, fit only for the vulgar.” The
remedy enjoined for this matter is thus stated: “Were
a competent number of schools erected to educate
Ladies ingeniously, methinks I see how ashamed men
would be of their ignorance, and how industrious the
next generation would be to wipe off the reproach!”
The author adds: “Let not your Ladyship be offended
that I do not, as some have wittily done, plead for
female preëminence. To ask too much, is the way
to be denied all.”</p>

<p>To prove that women were formerly educated in
arts and tongues, the author names a score and more
of Greek, Roman, and other ladies celebrated for
their proficiency in those respects.</p>

<p>“How,” asks the author, “could the Sibyls have
invented heroic, or Sappho ‘sapphick,’ or Corinna
have thrice beaten Pindar at lyric verses, if they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
not been highly educated?” And to prove that the
young ladies of both Greece and Rome were
instructed in all kinds of good literature, the writer
refers to a learned duel between twenty ladies a side,
from each nation, in which the Grecian women came
off the better in philosophy, and the Roman superior
in oratory.</p>

<p>As instances of admirably educated English women,
the following persons are named, with much eulogistic
comment:</p>

<p>The Lady Jane Gray. The “present Duchess of
Newcastle, who, by her own genius, rather than
any timely instruction, overtops many grave Gown-men.”
The Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, a
pupil of Mrs. Makin’s; “well she understands Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, French, and Spanish,” and “what a
proficient she is in arts subservient to Divinity, in
which (if I durst, I would tell you) she excels.” The
Princess Elizabeth, daughter to King Charles the
First, to whom Mrs. Makin was tutoress, “at nine
years old, could write, read, and in some measure
understand Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, and
Italian: had she lived, what a miracle she would
have been of her sex. Mrs. Thorold, daughter of the
Lady Car, in Lincolnshire, was excellent in philosophy,
and all sorts of learning. I cannot, without
injury, forget the Lady Mildmay and Doctor Love’s
daughters: their worth and excellency in learning is
yet fresh in the memory of many men.” Finally, as
the greatest sample of all, the author describes Queen
Elizabeth at some length, who, “according to Ascham,
read more Greek in a day than many of the
doctors of her time did Latin in a week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>In the Postscript to the above essay, the following
passages occur:</p>

<p>“If any enquire where this education may be
performed, such may be informed that a school is
lately erected for Gentlewomen, at Tottenham High
Cross, within four miles of London, on the road to
Ware, where Mrs. Makin is governess, who was formerly
tutoress to the Princess Elizabeth, daughter to
King Charles the First. Where, by the blessing of
God, Gentlewomen may be instructed in the Principles
of religion, and in all manner of sober and
virtuous Education: more particularly in all things
ordinarily taught in other schools.</p>

the Royal Exchange; and Thursdays, at the ‘Bolt
and Tun,’ in Fleet Street, between the hours of three
and six in the afternoon, by some person whom Mrs.
Makin shall appoint.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Makin’s school, under herself and her successors,
and her system, adopted by imitators, had
good influences in their “little day.” Those influences
continued beyond that period in families like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
that of Mrs. Robinson, where every variety of knowledge
was accounted valuable. It was a period when
grace of carriage was held by others to be as necessary
as a well-stored mind; and very popular in
some English households was a little volume from
the French, called “The Art of being Easy at all
Times and in all Places, written chiefly for the use of
a Lady of Quality.”</p>

<p>In the Robinson family, personal grace came
naturally; but the mind was cultivated. Indeed, in
that household, the wits were not allowed to rust.
It was the delight of those bright girls and boys to
maintain or to denounce, for the sport’s sake, some
particular argument set up for the purpose. Occasionally
the pleasant skirmish would develop into
something like serious battle. The triumphant laugh
of the victor would now and then bring tears to the
eyes of the vanquished. At such times there was a
moderator of the excited little assembly. The mother
of the young disputants sat at a table close at hand.
She read or worked; sometimes she listened smilingly,
sometimes was not without apprehension. But
she was equal to the emergency. Her children recognised
her on such occasions as “Mrs. Speaker;”
and that much-loved dignitary always adjourned the
house when victory was too hotly contested, or when
triumph seemed likely to be abused.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that Elizabeth Robinson, who
was the liveliest of these disputants, assumed or submitted
to the drudgery of copying the whole of the
<i>Spectator</i>, when she was only eight years of age.
Her courage and perseverance, however, were equal
to such a task; but her energies were often turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
in another direction. She was as unreservedly given
to dancing, she tells us, as if she had been bitten by a
tarantula. She as ardently loved fun—“within the
limits of becoming mirth”—as she devotedly pursued
learning.</p>

<p>“My mind used to sleep,” she writes to Lord
Lyttelton, “eight or ten hours without even the visitation
of a dream, and rose in the morning, like
Aurora, throwing freshness and joy on every object,
tricked itself out in sunbeams, and set in gay and
glowing colours.” With a head furnished with knowledge
beyond that possessed by most girls of her age;
with feet restless and impatient to join any dance
anywhere; she had a heart most sisterly and tenderly
attuned to love for, and sympathy with, her brothers.
“I have seven of them,” she wrote, while she was yet
in her teens, “and would not part with one for a
kingdom. If I had but one, I should be distracted
about him. Surely, no one has so many or so good
brothers.” This is only one out of a score of such
testimonies of sisterly affection.</p>

<p>There are some significant traces of the effects of
this lady’s early training in the letters which she
wrote from the time she was twelve years of age till
she had reached her twenty-second year, when she
married. These letters were addressed to a friend
older than herself, Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley,
who, in 1734, became Duchess of Portland. They
are sprightly and forcible, but they are not “girlish.”
In one of the earliest, written at Horton, near
Hythe, Kent (one of the estates which Matthew
gained by his marriage), she says: “My papa is a
little vapoured, and last night, after two hours’ silence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
he broke out into a great exclamation against the
country, and concluded by saying, that living in the
country was sleeping with one’s eyes open. He has
ordered me to put a double quantity of saffron in
his tea.” For what purpose this remedy was ordered,
may be guessed from a passage in a comedy of
Charles the Second’s time, by Howard. “Saffron-posset-drink
is very good against the heaviness of
the spirits,” says Mrs. Arbella, in “The Committee.”</p>

<p>Young Miss Robinson was fond of illustrating her
early letters by images taken from life, and set up
after the fashion of popular novelists. One of these
figures occurs in a letter addressed to the Duchess
of Portland, in May, 1734, when the lively writer had
not yet completed her fourteenth year: “I am surprised
that my answer to your Grace’s letter has
never reached your hands. I sent it immediately to
Canterbury, by the servant of a gentleman who dined
here; and I suppose he forgot to put it in the
post.... If my letter were sensible, what would be
its mortification, that, instead of having the honour
to kiss your Grace’s hands, it must live confined in
the footman’s pocket, with greasy gloves, rotten
apples, mouldy nuts, a pack of dirty cards, and the
only companion of its sort—a tender epistle from
his sweetheart, ‘tru till Deth;’ perhaps, by its situation,
subject to be kicked by his master every morning,
till at last, by ill-usage and rude company, worn
too thin for any other use, it may make its exit by
lighting a tobacco-pipe.”</p>

<p>The young writer of the above was not only remarkably
observant of all that passed around her, but
generally showed her reading by a quotation that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
should give force to the description of what she
observed. Thus, in writing to her dear duchess, who
had been suffering from fever (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1734), Miss Robinson
remarks: “I shall put on as musty a face at
your Grace’s fever as Miss W—— could make at the
face of Doctor Sandys, to describe the horror of which
would require at least as tragic a bard as Lee; for
then she would look, good gods! how she would
look!” This may smack of priggishness; but there
was nothing of that, nor of false prudery, in Elizabeth
Robinson’s character. Before she was fifteen,
she had some experiences not likely to fall to the lot
of young ladies of the present day. “I have in
winter,” she writes to Mrs. Anstey, “gone eight
miles to dance to the music of a blind fiddler, and
returned at two o’clock in the morning, mightily
pleased that I had been so well entertained.” Indeed,
young ladies seem to have been thoroughly emancipated,
and to have been abroad in the “wee sma’
hours ’ayont the twal,” enjoying all the perils consequent
on such rather wild doings. In 1738, when
our young lady was not quite eighteen, she went, with
two of her brothers and her sister, eight miles to the
play, from her Kentish home; and she tells the
Duchess of Portland, “After the play, the gentlemen
invited all the women to a supper at the inn, where
we stayed till two o’clock in the morning, and then
all set out for our respective homes.” The frolicsome
damsel adds, “Before I had gone two miles,
I had the pleasure of being overturned, at which I
squalled for joy.” It was, perhaps, this indulgence
in fun and late hours, joined to much solid reading,
that made this youthful reveller and student hate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
early morning hours as she hated cards. But her
“quality” was favourably shown in her ready observance
of the law and custom of the house in which
she happened to be a sojourner. There is no better
proof than this of what is understood by “good
breeding.” She would rather have gone down to
breakfast at noon than at nine; but if the breakfast-hour
of her entertainers was at eight, there was the
young guest at table, fresh as the rose and brighter
than the dawn. She amusingly illustrated this
matter once, by writing from a house where she was
tarrying, “Six o’clock in the morning; New Style.”</p>

<p>In fact, few things came amiss to her. No doubt
she preferred Mary-le-bone Gardens to those at
Edgeley or at Horton. She was happy in both, but
happier in the fashionable gardens nearer London; for
Mary-le-bone was still out of town. Elizabeth Robinson’s
day is described, on one of these occasions, as
breakfasting in Mary-le-bone Gardens at ten; giving
a sitting to Zincke after midday, for her well-known
miniature portrait as Anne Boleyn; and spending the
evening at Vauxhall. At the nobility’s private balls
given in the first-named suburban paradise, Elizabeth
Robinson was amongst the gayest and fairest of the
revellers. Before the dance began in those days the
ladies’ fans were thrown upon a table, and the men
then drew them for partners, each taking for his own
the lady to whom the fan which he had drawn, and
which he presented to her, belonged. It was not all
breakfasting and dancing in those gardens. There
was a large plunging-bath there, much used by
fashionable Naiads, who rose from silken couches,
donned a bathing-dress, took headers into the waters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
gambolled in and under them till they were breathless,
and then went home to dress for other enjoyments.
When the Duchess of Portland heard of her young
friend’s plunging delights, she expressed herself
“frightened out of her wits.” But, on the other
hand, Lord Dupplin wrote a couple of verses on this
particular Naiad, and in honour of the poet, the laughing
nymph again and again took headers into the glad
waters of Mary-le-bone.</p>

<p>The home scenes of her life in the country come
out strong in contrast with those of her life in London.
In a lively sketch of one of these scenes, drawn
for the duchess’s amusement, the youthful artist thus
joyously describes herself and her doings:</p>

<p>“One common objection to the country is, one sees
no faces but those of one’s own family; but my papa
thinks he has found a remedy for that, by teaching
me to draw; but then he husbands these faces in so
cruel a manner, that he brings me sometimes a nose,
sometimes an eye, at a time; but on the king’s birthday,
as it was a festival, he brought me out a whole
face, with its mouth wide open.” In another letter,
she says: “I would advise you not to draw old men’s
heads. It was the rueful countenance of Socrates or
Seneca that first put me out of conceit with it. Had
my papa given me the blooming faces of Adonis and
Narcissus, I might have been a very apt scholar; and
when I told him I found their great beards difficult
to draw, he gave me St. John’s head in a charger.
So, to avoid the speculation of dismal faces, which,
by my art, I dismalised ten times more than they
were before, I threw away my pencil. If I drew a
group of little figures, I made their countenances so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
sad and their limbs so distorted, that from a set of
laughing Cupids, they looked like the tormented
infants in Herod’s cruelty, and smiling, became like
Rachel weeping for her children.” After more in
this strain, she calls herself the best hospital painter;
“for I never drew a figure that was not lame or blind,
and they had all something of the horrible in their
countenances ... you would have thought they had
seen their own faces in the glass.”</p>

<p>Her failure in the above respect at home found
ample compensation in success at Tunbridge Wells,
at Bath, and at country races, at all of which Elizabeth
Robinson’s beauty attracted all eyes; her vivacious
wit charmed or stung all ears. At these places,
she studied life quite as much as she enjoyed its pleasures;
and she could not go down a dance at the
Wells or at “The Bath,” without making little mental
epigrams on the looks of newly married people, the
manners of lovers, and the doings of eccentric folk.
These found their way, in writing, to her ducal friend,
who had already bestowed on the restless maiden the
nickname of “La Petite Fidget.”</p>

<p>At Bath, she was as restless, as observant, and as
epigrammatic as at Tunbridge Wells. She describes
Bath life, in 1740, as consisting all the morning of
“How d’ye does?” and all night of “What’s
Trumps?” The women, in the “Ladies’ Coffee
House,” talk only of diseases. The men, “except
Lord Noel Somerset, are altogether abominable.
There is not one good; no, not one.” Among the
lady eccentrics, was a certain dowager duchess, who,
said Miss Robinson, “bathes, and, being very tall,
had nearly drowned a few women in the Cross Bath;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
for she had ordered it to be filled till it reached her
chin; and so all those who were below her stature, as
well as her rank, were obliged to come out or
drown.”</p>

<p>The glance thus obtained into the Bath itself only
gives, as it were, a momentary view of the fashionable
people in those fashionable waters. They who compare
old accounts with what is now to be seen will
agree that he who looks, at the present day, into the
dull, dark, and simmering waters can have no conception
of the jollity, frolic, riot, dissipation, and indecorum
which once reigned there. There was a regular
promenade in the waters, and the promenaders were
of both sexes. They were in bathing-costumes,
and walked with the water nearly up to their necks.
The heads of the shorter people appeared to be floating.
At the same time, they were frolicking, or
flirting, or otherwise amusing themselves. Those
who came for sanitary purposes were hanging on
by the rings in the wall, and were sedulously parboiling
themselves. The Cross Bath was the famous
quality bath. Handsome japanned bowls floated
before the ladies, laden with confectionery, or with
oils, essences, and perfumery for their use. Now and
then one of these bowls would float away from its
owner, and her swain would float after it, bring it
again before her, and, if he were in the humour,
would turn on his back and affect to sink to the bottom,
out of mere rapture at the opportunity of serving
her. The spectators in the gallery looked on,
laughed, or applauded till the hour for closing came.
Therewith came half-tub chairs, lined with blankets,
whose owners plied for fares, and carried home the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
steaming freight at a sharp trot and a shilling for the
job.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Robinson’s friendship with Lord Lyttelton
is well known. At a court assembly, at St. James’s,
in 1740, the gentleman in question was present. He
was then plain Mr. Lyttelton, son and heir of Sir
Thomas, and about a year over thirty. The young
lady observed him in the brilliant scene more closely
and more approvingly than she did others. “The
men were not fine,” she writes to her Grace; but she
makes exception. “Mr. Lyttelton was, according to
Polonius’ instruction, rich, not gaudy; costly, but not
exprest in fancy.” In her eyes and to her mind, he
was a perfect gentleman and scholar. “Mr. Lyttelton
has something of an elegance in all his compositions,
let the subject be ever so trifling.... Happy
is the genius that can drink inspiration at every stream
and gather similes with every nosegay.” Alas! the
elegance of the last century embraced much that was
otherwise. The present Lord Lyttelton would not
dare to read aloud to a company of ladies and gentlemen
the once popular and elegant poem which his
ancestor addressed to Belinda!</p>

<p>In the days here referred to, there were two circumstances
to which all maidens looked forward as
their probable but not equally desirable lot, namely,
marriage and the smallpox. The latter fell on Elizabeth
Robinson’s sister Sarah, when the family were
resident at Horton, near Hythe. The elder sister
was sent to a neighbouring gentleman farmer’s, so
called solely because he tilled a few acres of his own.
Here, the Iphigenia aroused unwonted sympathies in
the breast of the Squire Cymons. She would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
nothing to do with furthering the humanising process
of those dull and thirsty clods. Their scarlet waistcoats
did not impress her like Mr. Lyttelton’s birthday
suit at court. One heaving swain, she thought,
would make an admirable Polyphemus! He stared
at her just as the calves did; but the calves had instinct
enough not to say anything to her. They were
preferable to the squire, to whom the young girl, with
her bright intellect, could not be persuaded “to lend
out her liking on land security.” There is a world of
meaning in what she wrote on that occasion to her
correspondent: “I liked neither him nor myself any
better for all the fine things he said.” She was a
creature not to be wooed or won by a tippling, foxhunting
clown, rich in the possession of dirt. She
had finely strung sensibilities, which would not attune
themselves to “the loud laugh which speaks the vacant
mind.” Mrs. Pendarves, who saw much of her in
the town and country mansions of the Duchess of
Portland, recognised the above fact. “Fidget,” she
wrote, in the year last named, “is a most interesting
creature; but I shall not attempt to draw a likeness....
There are some delicate touches that would foil
the skill of a much abler artist than I pretend to be.”</p>

<p>Just then her fears for her sister were even stronger
than her antipathies for her Kentish lovers. In order
to satisfy her eagerness to be assured that the sister
she loved was out of danger, the latter was allowed to
walk veiled into the fields, within speaking distance
of the other. Veiled, because she had cruelly suffered,
and it was thought better not to shock the
elder sister by a sight of the devastation which the
foul disease had worked temporarily on the beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the younger. Thus, the sisters stood, for a brief
time, speaking all that love and hope suggested, and
the sound of the convalescent sister’s voice fell like
delicious music on the heart of the listener.</p>

<p>With renewed health came uninterrupted happiness,
and gay mingling in gay society, and audacity of expression
when describing it. Elizabeth Robinson had
felt almost as much contempt for the fops among the
soldiers of her day, as disgust for the country Polyphemuses
who made her wrathful with their wooing.
Very severe was she on “the scarlet beaux,” who
were ordered to Flanders. “I think,” she says, “they
will die of a panic and save their enemies’ powder.
Well! they are proper gentlemen. Heaven defend
the nunneries! I will venture a wager Flanders increases
in the christenings more than in the burials of
the week.”</p>

<p>In describing changes in fashion, she makes singular
application of her historical knowledge. In 1741,
she wrote to her sister, from town: “I do not know
what will become of your fine shape, for there is a
fashionable make which is very strange. I believe
they look in London as they did in Rome after the
Rape of the Sabines!”</p>

<p>As this fair young Elizabeth remembered her history
on one occasion, so did she show on another that
she had not forgotten her church catechism. “As
for modern marriages,” wrote the lady, just then
going out of her teens, “they are great infringers of
the baptismal vow; for it is commonly the pomps and
vanities of this wicked world on one side, and the sinful
lusts of the flesh on the other.”</p>

<p>There are traces throughout Miss Robinson’s early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
letters of how it went with her own heart and its
sympathies. In her eighteenth year, she wrote to
the Duchess of Portland: “I never saw one man
that I loved.” She added to this assertion such an
endless list of virtues, merits, qualities, etc., which
she expected to find in that happy individual, as to
lead to the conclusion that a monster so faultless
would never be created. She even half-acknowledged
as much; for she wrote, “I am like Pygmalion,
in love with a picture of my own drawing; but I
never saw an original like it in my life. I hope when
I do, I shall, as some poet says, find the ‘statue
warm.’” In her nineteenth year, she gave utterance
to a pretty petulance in these words: “I wish some
of our neighbours had married two and twenty years
ago; we should have had a gallant young neighbourhood;
but they have lost time, and we have lost
lovers by that delay.” To a remark of her sister’s,
that, if she were not heedful, some handsome fool
would win her in spite of herself, she replied, that, to
win her heart, “it must be rather fair-spoken than
fair-faced.” She was not much moved when rivals in
beauty passed into the married state before her. In
1741, there are the following autobiographical details
in letters to the wife of the Reverend Mr. Freind, of
Canterbury: “I saw some fine jewels that are to
adorn my fair enemy, Mrs. S——. I beheld them
without envy, and was proud to think that a woman
who is thought worthy to wear jewels to adorn her
person, should do me the honour to envy and hate
me.... Surely, of all vanities, that of jewels is the
most ridiculous; they do not even tend to the order
of dress, beauty, and cleanliness; for a woman is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
not a jot the handsomer or cleaner for them.” And
again: “I am confined again by a little feverishness.
I thought, as it was a London fever, it might be
polite, so I carried it to the Ridotto, court, and opera,
but it grew perverse and stubborn, so I put it into a
white hood and double handkerchief, and kept it by
the fireside these three days, and it is better; indeed,
I hope it is worn out. On Saturday, I intend to go
to Goodman’s Fields, to see Garrick act ‘Richard the
Third’ that I may get one cold from a regard to
sense. I have sacrificed enough to folly, in catching
colds at the great puppet-shows in town.”</p>

<p>Subsequently, she would have her friend’s husband
believe that she was another fair vestal of the west,
who meant to pass through the world in maiden meditation,
fancy-free. She writes to the Reverend Dean
of Canterbury: “I have lately studied my own foibles,
and have found that I should make a very silly wife
and an extremely foolish mother, and so have as far
resolved as is consistent with deference to reason and
advice, never to trouble any man or to spoil any
children.” This was but banter. Only the year
before, her sister having made a jest of her love for
heroes of antiquity, Elizabeth Robinson oracularly
answered, “I believe I shall do my errand before
many people think; but prudence shall be my guide.
A living man,” exclaims the wise virgin, “is better
than a dead hero!”</p>

<p>In 1741, this decided young lady was wooed by a
fashionable lover, and also by a noble lover who was
her senior by a good many years. The former was
dismissed, and the young lady wrote to her sister in
the above year: “Poor M. B. takes his misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
so to heart, that I really pity him; but I have no
balsam of heartsease for him. If he should die, I
will have him buried in Westminster Abbey, next to
the woman who died with the prick of a finger, for it
is quite as extraordinary; and he shall have his figure
languishing in wax, with ‘Miss Robinson fecit,’ written
over his head. I really compassionate his sufferings
and pity him; but though I am as compassionate,
I am as cold as charity. He pours out his soul in
lamentations to his friends, and all—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘But the nymph that should redress his wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Attend his passion, and approve his song!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">... I am glad he has such a stock of flesh to waste
upon.... I am really quite fat; and if there were
not some hope that I might get lean again, by raking
in town, I should be uneasy at it. I am now the
figure of ‘Laugh-and-be-fat,’ and begin to think myself
a comely personage. Adieu! Supper is on
table.”</p>

<p>And the saucy nymph “really did her errand”
before many thought. She declined the offer of the
man of fashion, and said “Yes” to the suit of
the older scholar and gentleman.</p>

<p>The practical conclusion came in due time. In
the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for August, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1742,
there is the record of eleven marriages. Four of
them saucily chronicle the fortunes of the brides.
Among the other seven may be read this brief
announcement: “August 5, Edward Montagu, Esq.,
member for Huntingdon, to the eldest daughter of
Matthew Robinson, of Horton, in Kent, Esq.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

</div>

<p>Edward Montagu was the son of Charles, who
was the fifth son of the first Earl of Sandwich. He
was a well-endowed gentleman, both intellectually
and materially, and he adopted the Socratic maxim,
that a wise man keeps out of public business. He
is described as being “of a different turn from his
wife, fond of the severer studies, particularly mathematics.”
Under his influence, the bounding Iambe
from Horton gradually grew into the “Minerva,” as
she was called by friends as well as epigrammatists.
Mr. Montagu was a mathematician of great eminence;
and a coal-owner of great wealth. He was a man of
very retired habits and great amiability. He loved
to puzzle fellow mathematicians with problems, and
he did not dislike coals to be high in price; but he
urged other owners to incur the odium of “making
the advance.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Montagu were married in London,
and did not immediately leave it. Mr. Freind officiated
at the marriage ceremony. The bride, in a
note to Mrs. Freind, expressed her infinite obligation
to him, “for not letting the knot be tied by the
hands of an ordinary bungler.” On Friday, August
6th, the day after her marriage, the bride wrote to
the Duchess of Portland: “If you will be at home
to-morrow, at two o’clock, I will pass an hour with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
you; but pray send me word to Jermyn Street at
eleven, whether I can come to you without meeting
any person at Whitehall but the duke; to every one
else pray deny your dressing-room. Mr. Freind will
tell your Grace I really behaved magnanimously; not
one cowardly tear, I assure you, did I shed at the
solemn altar; my mind was in no mirthful mood
indeed. I have a great hope of happiness. The
world, as you say, speaks well of Mr. Montagu, and I
have many obligations to him which must gain my
particular esteem; but such a change of life must
furnish one with a thousand anxious thoughts.”</p>

<p>Shortly after, the newly wedded pair travelled to
one of Mr. Montagu’s estates in the north; but not
alone. They were accompanied by the bride’s sister.
The custom of sending a chaperon with a young
married couple prevailed. Indeed, down to a comparatively
recent period, some husbands and wives,
who were married in Yorkshire, may remember that
to have started on their wedding trip, or their journey
home, without a third person, would have been considered
lamentable indecorum.</p>

<p>The bride thus speaks of the journey and the new
home. To Mrs. Freind, she writes:</p>

<p>“We arrived at this place (Allerthorpe, Yorkshire),
after a journey of six days through fine countries.
Mr. Montagu has the pleasure of calling many hundred
pounds a year about his house his own, without
any person’s property interfering with it. I think it
is the prettiest estate and in the best order I ever
saw: large and beautiful meadows for riding or walking
in, and all as neat as a garden, with a pretty river
(the Swale) winding about them, on which we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
sometimes go in boats. I propose to visit the almshouse
very soon. I saw the old women, with the
bucks upon their sleeves, at church, and the sight
gave me pleasure. Heraldry does not always descend
with such honour as when charity leads her by the
hand.” A little later, Mrs. Montagu writes thus to
the duchess:</p>

<p>“The sun gilds every object, but I assure you, it
is the only fine thing we have had; for the house is
old and not handsome: it is very convenient, and
the situation extremely pleasant. We found the
finest peaches, nectarines, and apricots that I have
ever eat.” Then comes a dash of the old sauciness.
She rejoices at the news the duchess had communicated
to her, that Lord Dupplin, who once wrote
verses on her taking a header into the Mary-le-bone
plunging-baths, was the father of an heir to his title
and estate. “I think no man better deserves a child.
The end justifies the means; else, what should one
say for his extreme, surprising, amazing fondness for
the lady?... I am glad Lord Dupp enjoys his
liberty and leisure. The repose a gentleman takes
after the honour of sending a son into the world,
may be called ease with dignity.”</p>

<p>Further evidences of the course of her married life
are thus afforded by herself. On the 24th of August,
Mrs. Montagu tells the duchess:</p>

<p>“It must be irksome to submit to a fool. The
service of a man of sense is perfect freedom. Where
the will is reasonable, obedience is a pleasure; but
to run of a fool’s errand all one’s life is terrible.”
And three days later, she writes to Mrs. Freind:
“I think we increase in esteem, without decaying in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
complaisance; and I hope we shall always remember
Mr. Freind and the 5th with thankfulness.”</p>

<p>Early in October, Mr. Montagu left his wife,
parliamentary business calling him to town. She
dreaded the invasion of condoling neighbours, and not
without reason. “We have not been troubled with
any visitors since Mr. Montagu went away; and
could you see how ignorant, how awkward, how
absurd, and how uncouth the generality of people are
in this country, you would look upon this as no small
piece of good fortune. For the most part, they are
drunken and vicious, and worse than hypocrites—profligates.
I am very happy that drinking is not
within our walls. We have not had one person disordered
by liquor since we came down, though most
of the poor ladies in the neighbourhood have had
more hogs in their drawing-room than ever they had
in their hog-sty.” One visitor was unwelcomely assiduous.
She thus hits him off to the duchess, as a
portrait of a country beau and wit: “Had you seen
the pains this animal has been taking to imitate the
cringe of a beau, you would have pitied him. He
walks like a tortoise and chatters like a magpie....
He was first a clown, then he was sent to the Inns of
Court, where first he fell into a red waistcoat and
velvet breeches, then into vanity. His light companions
led him to the playhouse, where he ostentatiously
coquetted with the orange wenches, who cured
him of the bad air of taking snuff.... He then
fell into the company of the jovial, till want of money
and want of taste led this prodigal son, if not to eat,
to drink with swine.... At last ... he returned
to the country, where ... people treat him civilly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
... and one gentleman in the neighbourhood is so
fond of him as, I believe, to spend a great deal of
money and most of his time upon him.”</p>

<p>There are parts in the letter, from which the above
is an extract, which show a knowledge of London
life, and of the consequences of leading it, which is
marvellous. In more lively strain, this Lady of the
Last Century moralised on marriage, under all its
aspects, to the duchess; and she joked upon and
handled the same subject, in her letters to Mrs.
Donellan, with an astounding audacity, which was,
however, not unnatural, in the days when mothers
read Aphra Behn aloud, and sons and daughters
listened to that arch-hussy’s highly flavoured comedies.
Mrs. Montagu alludes to similar reading when
drawing an “interior” for the duchess’s good pleasure,
while Mr. Montagu was away. “I cannot boast
of the numbers that adorn our fireside. My sister
and I are the principal figures; besides, there is a
round table, a square skreen, some books, and a
work-basket, with a smelling-bottle, when morality
grows musty, or a maxim smells too strong, as sometimes
they will in ancient books.” She loved such
books, nevertheless, much better than she did the
neighbours that would be friendly.</p>

<p>“I do hourly thank my stars,” she says, “that I
am not married to a country squire or a beau; for
in the country, all my pleasure is in my own fireside,
and that only when it is not littered with queer
creatures. One must receive visits and return them
... and if you are not more happy in it in Nottinghamshire
than I am in Yorkshire, I pity you most
feelingly.... Could you but see all the good folks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
that visit my poor tabernacle, oh, your Grace would
pity and admire!”</p>

<p>There was neither “squire” nor “beau” in the
quiet, refined gentleman she had married. The wife
might well be sorry for the absence of such a companion.
He had left her, as she expressed it, to her
mortification, but with her approbation. She desired
him to go, yet half-wished him to stay; but at
last “got out honour’s boots, and helped him to draw
them on.” “Since I married,” she writes to Mrs.
Freind, “I have never heard him say an ill word to
any one; nor have I received one matrimonial frown.”
For a matrimonial life begun in August, clouds and
showers in October would have been an early prodigy
indeed. To the duchess, who asked more as to her
characteristic doings than her feelings, Mrs. Montagu
replied:</p>

<p><i>December 1742</i>—“Your Grace asks me if I have
left off footing and tumbling down-stairs. As to the
first, my fidgetations are much spoiled; sometimes I
have cut a thoughtless caper, which has gone to the
heart of an old steward of Mr. Montagu’s, who is as
honest as Trusty in the play of ‘Grief à la Mode.’ I
am told that he has never heard a hop that he has
not echoed with a groan.”</p>

<p>At another of Mr. Montagu’s houses, Sandleford,
near Newbury, Berks, his wife found more genial
neighbours than in the north. She especially disliked
the rough Yorkshire folk, and she did not conceal
the little sympathy she had with “agreeable company.”
She felt it a misfortune that she found in
few people the qualities that pleased her. Like him
who thanked God that he had not a heart that had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
room for many, she was thankful that she could love
only the chosen few; but she could bear with twenty
disagreeable people at once, while a tête-à-tête with a
single one she disliked made her sick. At Sandleford,
she played the farmer’s wife’s part without laying
aside that of the lady, or, indeed, of the student.
She could rattle off the gayest description of a country
fair, losing no one of its characteristic features,
and next write a long and thoughtful dissertation over
Gastrell, Bishop of Chester’s “Moral Proof of the
Certainty of a Future State.” The spirit of this dissertation,
contained in a long letter to her friend the
duchess, is that of what would now be called a Free
Inquirer. She will not bow her intellect to any authority
of mortal man. She has hope, but lacks
knowledge,—except that God is the loving father of
all,—and beyond that she evidently thinks the bishop
knows no more than she does.</p>

<p>The ladies around her, at Sandleford, were neither
so well endowed intellectually as herself, nor seemingly
cared to be. Grottos and shellwork showed
the bias of their tastes. Mrs. Montagu speaks of
visiting one in Berkshire, which was the work of nine
sisters (Leah), who in disposition, as well as number,
bore “some resemblance to the Muses.” Lord
Fane’s grotto at Basildon was one of the mild wonders
of the county. When she goes thence to London,
depreciation of the latter shows a growing love
for rural life. She describes life in London as being—all
the morning at the senate, all the night at play.
Party politics were her aversion. They were “pursued
for the benefit of individuals, not for the good
of the country.” The factious heads in London she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
described as being very full of powder and very
empty of thought. Happy in her own home, she
could mingle jesting with sympathy when referring
to sorrows which other people had to bear. “I pity
Miss Anstey,” she wrote, “for the loss of her agreeable
cousin and incomparable lover. For my part,
I would rather have a merry sinner for a lover than
so serious a saint!” Her own husband, however,
was not mirthful. He stuck to his mathematics,
understood his business as a coal-owner, loved his
wife, and found life a pleasant thing, particularly
where his lines had fallen.</p>

<p>With the birth of a boy came new occupations,
fresh delights, and hitherto unknown anxieties. The
nursing mother, remembering her old gay time, declared
that “for amusement there is no puppet-show
like the pleasant humour of my own Punch at Sandleford.”
She fancied a bright futurity for the boy;
but her passing ecstasy was damped by the thought
of the perils and temptations by which life is beset.
“Pity,” she wrote, “that a man thinks it no more
necessary to be as innocent as woman than to be as
fair.”</p>

<p>In March, 1744, when Mrs. Montagu and her
sister thought it a remarkable fear to travel from
Sandleford, near Newbury, to Dover Street, London,
in one day, with only two breakdowns, Mrs.
Montagu left her boy in the Berkshire house. “It
was no such easy matter,” she said, “to part with
little Punch, with whom we played and pleased ourselves
as long as we could afford time.” On her
return to Sandleford, in July, the natural beauty of
the place seemed centred in little Punch’s person.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
“He is now an admirable tumbler. I lay him down
on a blanket on the ground every morning, before he
is dressed, and at night when he is stripped, and
there he rolls and tumbles about, to his great delight.
If my goddaughter,” adds the Last Century Lady
to Doctor Freind, referring to his daughter, “be not
a prude, I should recommend the same practice to
her.”</p>

<p>The mother’s dreams and duties were soon brought
to a melancholy close. In September, 1744, the
little heir had his first severe experience of life, and,
perhaps happily, it was too much for him. He died
of convulsions while cutting his teeth. A few joyous
tumbles on the blanket, a few kisses, a few
honeyed words, and much pain at last, made up all
that he knew of life. Mrs. Montagu tempered her
heavy grief with much active occupation and study.
She meekly attributed the loss of her son to God’s
visitation on her confidence in her own care and
watchfulness. She may be said to have lost with
him her hopes, her joys, and her health for a considerable
period. In September, 1744, she wrote to the
duchess:</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Montagu shows me an example of
patience and fortitude, and endeavours to comfort
me, though undoubtedly he feels as much sorrow
as I can do; for he loved his child as much as ever
parent could do.” She discovered all the virtues
in Mr. Montagu that adversity needs, and adversity
only can show. “I never saw such resignation and
fortitude in any one; and in the midst of affliction
there is comfort in having such a friend and assistant.
It was once my greatest happiness to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
him in possession of the dearest of blessings. It is
now my greatest comfort to see he knows how to
resign it, and yet preserve the virtue and dignity
of his temper.” They never had another child;
and, if they were not altogether as happy as before,
they were, at least, as cheerfully resigned as heirless
rich people could persuade themselves to be. Occasionally,
however, she envied happier mothers. Referring
to one of these, nearly twenty years later,
who was then stricken by a profounder grief, Mrs.
Montagu wrote to Lord Lyttelon: “Poor Mrs.
Stone, between illness and affliction, is a melancholy
object. I remember that after my son was dead, I
used to envy her her fine boy; but not being of a
wicked disposition, did earnestly wish she might not
lose him. Poor woman! her felicity lasted longer
than mine, and so her grief must be greater: but
time is a sure comforter.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu found relief for her sorrows, as well
as for indisposition, from which she suffered greatly
at intervals, at Tunbridge Wells and in small country
gaieties. Thus, in 1745, at a country fair (ladies went
to such sports in those days), Mrs. Montagu was not
more surprised to see a gingerbread Admiral Vernon
lying undisturbed on a basket of Spanish nuts, than
she was at Tunbridge Wells to behold grave Doctor
Young and old Colley Cibber on the most intimate
terms. Mrs. Montagu, on the Pantiles, asked the
doctor how long he intended to stay, and his answer
was, “As long as your rival stays.” When this riddle
was explained, the “rival” proved to be the sun.
People from all ends of the world then congregated
at the Wells, and Mrs. Montagu sketched them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
smartly, and grouped them cleverly, in pen and ink.
One of the best of these outline sketches is that of a
country parson, the vicar of Tunbridge, to whom she
paid a visit in company with Doctor Young and Mrs.
Rolt. “The good parson offered to show us the
inside of his church, but made some apology for his
undress, which was a true canonical dishabille. He
had on a gray striped calamanco nightgown; a wig
that once was white, but, by the influence of an uncertain
climate, turned to a pale orange; a brown
hat encompassed by a black hatband; a band somewhat
dirty, that decently retired under the shadow of
his chin; a pair of gray stockings, well mended with
blue worsted, strong symptoms of the conjugal care
and affection of his wife, who had mended his hose
with the very worsted she had bought for her own.”
The lively lady and her companions declined to take
refreshment at the parsonage, where, she made no
doubt, they would have been “welcomed by madam,
in her muslin pinners and sarsnet hood; who would
have given us some mead and a piece of cake that
she had made in the Whitsun holidays, to treat her
cousins.” After dinner at the inn, the vicar joined
them, “in hopes of smoking a pipe, but our doctor
hinted to him, that it would not be proper to offer
any incense but sweet praise to such goddesses as
Mrs. Rolt and your humble servant. I saw a large
horn tobacco-box, with Queen Anne’s head upon it,
peeping out of his pocket.” Wherever Mrs. Montagu
wended during this autumn of 1745, she filled her
letters with these pen-and-ink sketches of what she
saw. But that eventful year brought more serious
duties. In 1745, when the Jacobites were about to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
invade England, Mr. Montagu went from London
to York, to aid in raising and arming the people.
The Yorkshire gentlemen acted with great spirit, and
stood by their homesteads instead of flying to London.
“Though it gives me uneasiness and anxiety,” wrote
the young wife, “I cannot wish those I love to act
otherwise than consistently with those principles of
honour that have always directed their actions.” The
rebellion spoiled the London gaieties. Drums and
routs had no longer a fashionable meaning. “I have
not heard of any assemblies since I came to town;
and, indeed, I think people frighten each other so
much when they meet, that there is little pleasure
arising from society.... There is not a woman in
England, except Lady Brown, that has a song or tune
in her head, but, indeed, her ladyship is very unhappy
at the suspension of operas.”</p>

<p>The death of Mrs. Montagu’s mother, in the following
year, drew from her a tender and well-deserved
tribute of affection in a touching and simple letter to
Mrs. Freind. In 1747, her friend, Mr. Lyttelton,
lost his first wife, and wrote a monody on her, for the
public ear. The monody walks on very high stilts,
and occasionally falls and struggles on the ground.
Mrs. Montagu thought it had great merit, and that
her friend would be inconsolable; but Lyttelton
brought out, the same year, his “Observations on
the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul,” of which
Mrs. Montagu was a diligent reader and a constant
eulogist. In less than two years, the widower left
unfinished a prettily begun epitaph to his Lucy, with
whom he had enjoyed six years of conjugal felicity,
and married a daughter of Sir Robert Rich. With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
her came a life of warfare, followed by a treaty by
which each party agreed to live at peace with, and
wide apart from, the other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Montagu made friendly progresses
to princely mansions in various parts of the country.
She had hearty welcome at all, from lay and ecclesiastical
nobles alike. This did not influence her critical
eye. At Wilton, then and now one of the best
examples of an English nobleman’s residence, she
writes: “As to the statues and bustos, they certainly
are very fine, but I think too many. Heroes should
not have so many competitors, nor philosophers so
much company; a respectable society may be increased
into a mob. I should, if they were mine, sell
half of their figures to purchase their works, which
are, indeed, the images of wise men.”</p>

<p>A cloud now came, and long rested, between her
and the sun of her happiness. The death, in 1748,
of her brother “Tom,” a man of wit, taste, and judgment,
after her own heart; “the man in England for
a point of law,” as Chief Justice Lee remarked; a
man who had accomplished much, and who might
have reasonably looked to the highest position, which
could be attained in his branch of the profession, as
his own,—the death of such a man, good, bright,
aspiring, and qualified for success, was a loss to his
brilliant sister for which she never found compensation.
“As for this good young man,” she wrote,
“I hoped it would rather have been his business to
have grieved for me. Mr. Montagu is most careful
of us, and I cannot, amidst my sorrow, help thanking
Heaven for such a friend.” A letter from her husband
in London confirms this statement: “I long to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
leave this place, and to be with you now, rather than
at a time when you have less occasion for a friend.
Be sure that you are constantly in my thoughts, and
that no accidents of sickness or any other matter can
work any change in me, or make me be with less
affection than I have been, my dearest life, your most
obliged and affectionate E. M.”</p>

<p>Compelled, subsequently, to repair to Bath for her
health, she despised no innocent amusement. “I
want mechanic helps,” she said, “for my real happiness,
God knows, is lessened; and, though I have
many relations left, I reflect that even this circumstance
makes me more liable to have the same affliction
repeated.” Then, after a week or two of
omnivorous reading and friendly intercourse, she
writes to the duchess: “Mrs. Trevanion, Lord Berkley
of Stratton’s sister, goes away from us to-morrow,
which I am sorry for; she seems very agreeable and
well-bred, and has a thousand other good qualities
that do not abound at our morning coffee-house,
where I meet her. Whist and the noble game of
E. O. employ the evening; three glasses of water, a
toasted roll, a Bath cake, and a cold walk, the mornings....
My physician says three months will be
necessary for me to drink the waters.... I am
forced to dine by myself, not yet being able to bear
the smell of what common mortals call a dinner. As
yet I live with the fairies.... But here is another
Mrs. Montagu, who is like me, hath a long nose, pale
face, thin cheeks, and also, I believe, diets with fairies,
and she is much better than when she came, and
many people give me the honour of her recovery.”</p>

<p>After returning to Sandleford, she began again to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
need, or to fancy she needed, the restoring waters
of Tunbridge. To Mrs. Anstey she wrote:</p>

<p>“I may, perhaps, trouble you to seek me some
house about Mount Elphinstone; for, to tell you the
truth, I get as far from the busy haunts of the place
as I can; for it agrees neither with my inclination nor
health to be in the midst of what are called the diversions
of the place. An evening assembly in July is
rather too warm; and, tell it not in the regions of
politeness, I had rather see a few glowworms on a
green in a warm summer’s evening than belles
adorned with brilliants or beaux bright with clinquant.
I cannot be at Tunbridge before the beginning
of July. I am engaged to the nightingale and
cuckoo for this month.”</p>

<p>Although continued ill-health kept Mrs. Montagu
much in retirement after she first went to Tunbridge,
the Wells had their usual effect. She was the centre
of a circle of admiring friends; and when established
for months together at Tunbridge Wells, her coterie
was a thing apart from those of the Jews, Christians,
and Heathens of all classes who crowded the Pantiles
or the assembly-rooms. Her letters sparkle with the
figures that flit through them. Some contemporary
ladies of the last century are thus sharply crayoned:
“I think the Miss Allens sensible, and I believe them
good; but I do not think the Graces assisted Lucina
at their birth.... Lady Parker and her two daughters
make a very remarkable figure, and will ruin the
poor mad woman of Tunbridge by outdoing her in
dress. Such hats, capuchins, and short sacks as were
never seen! One of the ladies looks like a state
bed running upon castors. She has robbed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
valance and tester of a bed for a trimming. They
have each of them a lover. Indeed, as to the dowager,
she seems to have no greater joys than E. O.
and a toad-eater can give her.” That word “toad-eater”
was still in its novelty as a slang term. In
1742, Walpole calls Harry Vane, afterward Earl of
Darlington, “Pulteney’s toad-eater.” In 1744, Sarah
Fielding, in “David Simple,” speaks of it as “a new
word.” To Mr. Montagu, his wife thus wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>:—I had, this morning, the pleasure
of your letter, which was in every respect agreeable,
and in none more so than your having fixed
your time for going to Sandleford, as I shall the
sooner hope to see my best and dearest friend
here.... I shall wish I could procure wings to
bring me to you on the terrace at Sandleford, where
I have passed so many happy hours in the conversation
of the best of companions and kindest of friends;
and I hope you will there recollect one who followed
your steps as constantly as your shadow. I am still
following them, for there are few moments in which
my thoughts are not employed in you, and ever in
the best and tenderest manner.... The charms of
Sandleford are strongly in my remembrance, but still
I would have you find that they want your little
friend.”</p>
</div>

<p>From the gaieties of Tunbridge Mrs. Montagu
went to the residence of a sage, Mr. Gilbert West.
She found less pleasure among the sculpture and
paintings of Wilton than under Gilbert West’s modest
roof at Wickham, in whose master she saw “that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
miracle of the moral world, a Christian poet;” and
in Mrs. West, something more than a tenth Muse or
a fourth Grace. To conversations with West are
attributed the deeper convictions of the truth of revealed
religion which Mrs. Montagu entertained
henceforward. She did not cease to be cheerful
because on one point she was more serious. In a
cottage which she hired near West’s house, she
playfully offered to her lady visitors wholesome brown
bread, sincerity, and red cow’s milk. With tastes
that could find gratification wherever she might be,
Mrs. Montagu was one of the happiest of women.
Most happy, not when she was queen, or one of the
queens, of society, but when she was among her
books. She was an indefatigable reader. She reflected
as deeply as she read carefully. The literature
of the world was known to her, in the original
text, or in translations, of which she would read three
or four of the same work; and, if she had a preference,
she would give an excellent reason for it. Her
criticisms on the works she read are always admirable,
whether she treats of a Thucydides in a French
dress, of Cowley’s imperfections as an amatory poet,
of Melmoth’s “Pliny’s Letters,” or of writers like
Richardson, whose “Clarissa Harlowe” is analysed
in one of the printed letters with a skill and insight
that might be envied by the best writers of the times
that have succeeded to her own. Fictitious and real
personages, she dissects both with the hand of an
operator who loves the work in which he excels. She
is equally great when treating of the heroes of
antiquity, or of the notorious Mrs. Pilkington, whose
fie! fie! ways seem to warrant her slapping her with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
her fan; but whose talent, pleasant audacity, and
suffering, soften Mrs. Montagu’s heart and lead her
to gently kiss both cheeks of the erring Lætitia.</p>

<p>At the close of 1750, her brother Robert went in
search of fortune to China, where, however, he found
a grave. In the following year, she writes to her
husband, who was on private business in the north:
“I have sat so constantly in Lady Sandwich’s
chimney-corner, I can give you little account of the
world.” She playfully says to her absent lord: “I
am glad you are so far tired of your monastic life
as to think of returning to the secular state of a
husband and member of Parliament.” She adds:
“You have too many virtues for the contracted life
of a monk, and, I thank my stars, are bound in
another vow, one more fit for you, as it is social, and
not selfish.” From Lady Sandwich’s chimney-corner,
and from much study, mixed with every-day
duties, it is pleasant to see her surrounded by the
Ladies Stanhope and Mrs. Trevor, who were adjusting
her dress when she went as the “queen-mother” to
the subscription masquerade. The dress was “white
satin, with fine new point for tuckers, kerchief and
ruffles; pearl necklace and earrings, and pearls
and diamonds on the head, and my hair curled after the
Vandyke picture.” Mr. Montagu was so pleased
with her appearance that, said the lady, “he has made
me lay by my dress, to be painted in when I see Mr.
Hoare again.” Better than her own presentment is
her picture of the too famous Miss Chudleigh at this
masquerade: “Miss Chudleigh’s dress, or rather undress,
was remarkable. She was Iphigenia for the
sacrifice; but so naked, the high priest might easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
inspect the entrails of the victim. The maids of
honour (not of maids the strictest) were so offended,
they would not speak to her.”</p>

<p>It was with happy facility Mrs. Montagu turned
from the studies she loved and the duties which she
came to consider as her privilege, to the gayest scenes
of life. “Though,” say she, “the education of
women is always too frivolous, I am glad mine had
such a qualification of the serious as to fit me for
the relish of the <i>belles bagatelles</i>.” No one better
understood the uses of money. When her husband
was in the north furthering his coal interests, she
wrote to him: “Though the coldness of our climate
may set coals in a favourable light, I shall be glad
to see as many of them turned to the precious metal
as possible.... I have a very good opinion of Mr.
Montagu and his wife. I like the prospect of these
golden showers, and so I congratulate you upon
them; but, most of all, I congratulate you upon the
disposition of mind which made you put the account
of them in a postscript.” The last words of her own
letters to her husband were invariably affectionate,
with a sentiment of submission that has a very old-fashioned
air about it. For example:</p>

<p>“Every tender wish and grateful thought wait on
you, and may you ever as kindly accept the only
gift in my power, the faithful love and sincere affection
of your most grateful and obedient wife, E. M.”
Again, in September, 1751, from Tunbridge Wells:
“To your prayer that we may never be so long
separated, I can, with much zealous fervour, say
Amen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

</div>

<p>In October, Mrs. Montagu was in her town house,
in Hill Street, receiving company. Guests of the
present day will read, perhaps with a smile of wonder,
the following illustration of the times: “The Duke
and Duchess of Portland and Lord Titchfield dined
with me to-day, and stayed till eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>In the year 1752, there was a subpreceptor to the
Prince of Wales, named George Lewis Scott. His
baptismal names were those of the King George I.,
at whose court in Hanover Scott’s father had held
some respectable office. The son was recommended
for the preceptorship by Bolingbroke to Bathurst, who
spoke in the candidate’s favour to the prince’s mother,
and the king’s sanction followed. Walpole describes
Scott as well-meaning, but inefficient, through undue
interference, and as a man of no “orthodox odour,
as might be expected of a protégé of Bolingbroke.”
Mr. Scott had literary tastes, and occasionally exercised
them with credit. Such a man seemed a fitting
wooer for Sarah Robinson, Mrs. Montagu’s clever
sister. The wooing sped, marriage followed, and separation,
from incompatibility of temper, came swiftly
on the heels of it. The correspondence throws no
light on a dark episode; but in April, 1752, Mrs.
Delany wrote to Mrs. Dewes, in reference to Mrs.
Scott’s marriage and the separation of herself and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
husband, the following words: “What a foolish
match Mrs. Scott has made for herself. Mrs. Montagu
wrote Mrs. Donellan word that she and the rest
of her friends had rescued her out of the hands of a
very bad man; but, for reasons of interest, they
should conceal his misbehaviour as much as possible,
but entreated Mrs. Donellan would vindicate her sister’s
character whenever she heard it attacked, for
she was very innocent.” Perhaps it was the misery
that came of this marriage that made Mrs. Montagu
conclude a letter from Heys to her husband, during
this year, with these words: “Adieu, my dearest,
may you find amusement everywhere, but the most
perfect happiness with her who is by every grateful
and tender sentiment your most affectionate and
faithful wife, E. M.” The writer herself could find
amusement everywhere. A country-house, well-furnished
with books, made Sandleford more agreeable
to her than the glories within and the dust without
her house in Hill Street. She speaks deliciously of
having her writing-table beneath the shade of the Sandleford
elms, and she thus pleasantly contrasts country-house
employments with the pleasures of reading
ancient history, which lightened the burthen of those
employments: “To go from the toilet to the senate-house;
from the head of a table to the head of an
army; or, after making tea for a country justice, to
attend the exploits, counsels, and harangues of a Roman
consul, gives all the variety the busy find in the
bustle of the world, and variety and change (except in
a garden) make the happiness of our lives.” She
read Hooke’s “Roman History” as an agreeable variety.
Her mind was stronger than her body. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
was now only thirty-two years of age; and she writes
to Gilbert West, that ex-lieutenant of horse, and honest
inquirer into theological questions: “You will
imagine I am in extraordinary health, when I talk of
walking two miles in a morning.” If she could not
walk far, she could read and stand anything. In December,
she was again at home in Hill Street. On
Christmas Eve, 1752, she writes: “I proposed answering
my dear Mrs. Boscawen’s letter yesterday,
but the Chinese-room was filled by a succession of
people from eleven in the morning till eleven at night.”</p>

<p>Early in January, 1753, close upon the anniversary
of the death of the brother whom she dearly loved,—her
brother “Tom,”—who died a bachelor, in 1748,
an event occurred, the bearing of which is only partially
told in a letter from Mrs. Montagu to Gilbert
West: “My mind was so shocked at my arrival here,
that for some days I was insupportably low. I am
now better able to attend to the voice of reason and
duty. A friendship, begun in infancy, and reunited
by our common loss and misfortune, had many tender
ties. By tender care I had raised her from despair
almost to tranquillity. I had hourly the greatest of
pleasures, that of obliging a most grateful person. She
made every employment undertaken for me, and every
expression of my satisfaction in her execution
of those employments, a pleasure. I received from
her kind offices, which, however considerable, fell
short of the zeal that prompted them. Of this, I do
not know that there is a pattern left in the world.
She was much endeared, and her loss embittered to
me by another consideration, which you may reasonably
blame, as it shows too fond an attachment to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
those things which we ought to resign to the Great
Giver; but while she was under my care, I thought a
kind of intercourse subsisted between me and a most
dear and valuable friend whom I lost this time five
years. Whatever I did for her I thought done for
that friend on whom my affections, hopes, and pride
were placed.”</p>

<p>This little romance having come to a sad conclusion,
Mrs. Montagu was soon afterward in town, running,
as she said, “from house to house, getting the cold
scraps of visiting conversation, served up with the indelicacy
and indifference of an ordinary, at which no
power of the mind does the honours; the particular
taste of each guest is not consulted, the solid part of
the entertainment is too gross for a delicate taste, and
the lighter fare insipid. Indeed, I do not love fine
ladies, but I am to dine with ... to-morrow, notwithstanding.”
Again, in November, 1754, she
writes from Hill Street, the day after her arrival: “In
my town character, I made fifteen visits last night. I
should not so suddenly have assumed my great hoop,
if I had not desired to pay the earliest respects to
Lady Hester Pitt, who is something far beyond a
merely fine lady.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu did not seek for friends exclusively
among the great. With her and with Lyttelton, intellect
was the chief attraction. They both received
into their friendship the refugee Bower, who made
so much noise in his day. Mrs. Montagu and Lyttelton
refused to abandon him when he was assailed by
his enemies. When she was told, in a letter from a
Roman Catholic, that Bower, the ex-Jesuit whom she
had received in her house, was a knave, that his wife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
was a hussy, and that Mrs. Montagu herself was an
obstinate idoliser and a perverse baby for believing in
them, she continued her trust, despised report, and
asked for facts.</p>

<p>In 1755, Mrs. Montagu affected to detect the first
sign of her superannuation in her sudden resolution
not to go to Lady Townshend’s ball, though a new
pink silver negligée lay ready for the donning. Once,
she said, her dear friend, Vanity, could lure her over
the Alps or the ocean to a ball like Lady Townshend’s.
The day was past since she would have gone eight
miles, in winter, to dance to a fiddle, and would have
squalled with joy at being upset on her way home.
She and Vanity, she thought, had now parted. “I
really believe she has left me as lovers do their mistresses,
because I was too fond, denied her nothing,
and was too compliant to give a piquancy to our commerce.”
She was as “sharp” in judging others as
herself. Of Lady Essex (the daughter of Sir Charles
Hanbury Williams, who married the Earl of Essex in
1754, and died in 1759), Mrs. Montagu, in the intervening
year, 1756, says: “Lady Essex coquettes
extremely with her own husband, which is very lawful....
She wants to have the <i>bon ton</i>, and we
know the <i>bon ton</i> of 1756 is <i>un peu equivoque</i>.”</p>

<p>And now, in the year 1757, the celebrated word
“bluestockings” first occurs in Mrs. Montagu’s correspondence.
Boswell, under the date 1781, tells us
in his “Life of Johnson,” that “about this time, it
was much the fashion for several ladies to have evening
assemblies, where the fair sex might participate
in conversation with literary and ingenious men, animated
by a desire to please. These societies were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
denominated Blue Stocking Clubs. One of the most
eminent members of these societies, when they first
commenced, was Mr. Benjamin Stillingfleet, whose
dress was remarkably grave, and, in particular, it was
observed that he wore blue stockings. Such was the
excellence of his conversation, that his absence was
felt as so great a loss that it used to be said, ‘We
can do nothing without the blue stockings,’ and thus,
by degrees, the title was established.” Boswell was
greatly mistaken, for, in 1781, Benjamin Stillingfleet,
the highly accomplished gentleman, philosopher, and
barrack-master of Kensington, had been dead ten
years, and he had left off wearing blue stockings at
least fourteen years before he died. This subject
will be referred to in a subsequent page. Meanwhile,
in March, 1757, when rumours of war were
afloat, Mrs. Montagu gaily wrote to her husband;
“If we were in as great danger of being conquered
by the Spaniards as by the French, I should not be
very anxious about my continuance in the world; but
the French are polite to the ladies, and they admire
ladies a little in years, so that I expect to be treated
with great politeness, and as all laws are suspended
during violence, I suppose that you and the rest of
the married men will not take anything amiss that
happens on the occasion: nor, indeed, should it be a
much greater fault than keeping a monkey if one
should live with a French marquis for a quarter of a
year!” A little later, Walpole told George Montagu
a story which illustrates the scandal-power of the period.
“I was diverted,” he wrote, “with the story of
a lady of your name and a lord whose initial is no
further from hers than he himself is supposed to be.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Her postilion, a lad of fifteen, said, ‘I’m not such a
child but I can guess something! Whenever my
Lord Lyttelton comes to my lady, she orders the
porter to let in nobody else, and then they call for
pen and ink, and say they are going to write history!’
I am persuaded, now that he is parted, that he will
forget he is married, and propose himself in form to
some woman or other!”</p>

<p>Such scandal as this could not affect either of the
parties against whom it was pointed. In the next
following years of the reign of George the Second,
Mrs. Montagu led her usual life. In London, gay;
in the country, busy and thoughtful. “In London,”
she asks, “who can think? Perhaps, indeed, they
may who are lulled by soft zephyrs through the
broken pane, but it cannot happen to ladies in
Chinese-rooms!” In those rooms she received all,
native and foreign, whose brains or other desirable
possessions entitled them to a welcome. At Sandleford,
she was sometimes reading a translation of
Sophocles, dear to her almost as Shakespeare himself,
but as often she was amid accounts relative to firkins
of butter, tubs of soap, and chaldrons of coal. When
she left the country, it was in the odour of civility;
for Mr. and Mrs. Montagu invited a cargo of good
folks to dinner, and, like Sir Peter Teazle, left their
characters among them to be discussed till the next
season. In 1758, Mrs. Montagu became acquainted
with Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, the translator of Epictetus;
and Mr. Montagu, by the death of a relative,
succeeded to the inheritance of rich possessions in
the north. Mrs. Montagu thought she had got the
richer estate, in the learned lady who had become her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
friend. Nevertheless, she bore the accession of fortune
with hilarious philosophy. “As the gentleman
from whom Mr. Montagu inherits had been mad about
forty years, and almost bedridden for the last ten, I
had always designed to be rather pleased and happy
when he resigned his unhappy being and his good
estate.” She only fancied there was neither pleasure
nor happiness in it, because the “business” appertaining
to succession was wearisome.</p>

<p>When she found herself among the great coal-owners,
she was neither happy nor pleased. They
could only talk of coal, and of those who had been
made or ruined by it. “As my mind is not naturally
set to this tune,” she wrote to Mr. Benjamin Stillingfleet,
“I should often be glad to change it for a song
from one of your Welsh bards.” She, however,
intended to turn the occasion to intellectual profit by
exploring the country, and studying its beauties and
natural productions, but a little fainting fit put an
end to this design. An overzealous maid went to
her aid, when fainting, with a bottle of eau-de-luce,
but as she emptied the contents into Mrs. Montagu’s
throat, instead of applying it outwardly for refreshment,
the lady was nigh upon being then and there
deprived of upwards of forty years of life. She happily
recovered, and by and by she speaks of herself,
in London, as “going wherever two or three fools
were gathered together, to assemblies, visiting-days
etc. Twenty-four idle hours, without a leisure one
among them!” So she said; but an order to Mrs.
Denoyer, at the Golden Bible, Lisle Street, for
a hundred of the best pens and half a ream of the
finest and thinnest quarto paper, indicates how many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
hours of the twenty-four were employed. She
thought, or she affected to think, that she grew idler
as she grew older. In one of her letters to old
Doctor Monsey,—a grotesque savage and scholar,
who, in lugubrious jokery, wrote love-letters (which
she pretended to take seriously) at fourscore,—she
said, in September, 1757, just before her thirty-seventh
birthday: “I shall write to you again when
I am thirty-seven; but I am now engaged in a sort of
death-bed repentance for the idleness of the thirty-sixth
year of my age!” She certainly took a wrong
view of her case when she further said: “Having
spent the first part of my life in female vanities, the
rest in domestic employments, I seem as if I had
been measuring ribbons in a milliner’s, or counting
pennyworths of figs and weighing sugar-candy in a
grocer’s shop all my life.” This was no affectation.
“If you envy me,” she added, “or know any one who
does, pray tell them this sad truth. Nothing can be
more sad. Nothing can be more true.”</p>

<p>It would have been sad, if it had been true; but
she was severe in her own censure. If she cheerfully
plunged into the vortex of fashionable duties,
she persistently proclaimed her higher enjoyment of
home privileges. She sneered at her own presence
wherever two or three fools were gathered together,
but her honest ambition was to establish friendships
with the wise and the virtuous. Johnson assured
her of her “goodness so conspicuous,” and was
proud of being asked to use his influence to obtain
her support of poor Mrs. Ogle’s benefit concert, as it
gratified his vanity that he should be “supposed
to be of any importance to Mrs. Montagu.” With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
respect, at this time, for Johnson, she had a deeper
feeling of regard for Burke. “Mr. Burke, a friend
of mine.” There is reasonable pride in the assertion,
and how tenderly and cleverly she paints her
“friend!”—“He is, in conversation and writing, an
ingenious and ingenuous man, modest and delicate,
and on great and serious subjects full of that respect
and veneration which a good mind, and a great one, is
sure to feel; he is as good and worthy as he is
ingenious.” Her love of books was like her love of
friends. Dressed for a ball, she sat down, read
through the “Ajax” and the “Philoctetes” of Sophocles,
wrote a long critical letter on the two
dramas, and, losing her ball, earned her bed and the
deep sleep she enjoyed in it. At Tunbridge, she
describes the occupation of a single morning as consisting
of going to chapel, then to a philosophical
lecture, next to hear a gentleman play the viol
d’amore, and finally to hold controversy with a Jew
and a Quaker. In 1760, she was equally vivacious,
in “sad Newcastle.” In September of that year, she
writes to Lord Lyttelton, that she was taking up
her freedom, by entering into all the diversions of the
place. “I was at a musical entertainment yesterday
morning, at a concert last night, at a musical entertainment
this morning; I have bespoken a play for
to-morrow night, and shall go to a ball, on choosing
a mayor, on Monday night.” But in the hours of
leisure, between these dissipations, she fulfilled all her
duties as a woman of business in connection with
her steward’s accounts and the coal interests, and
devoted the remainder to the study of works in the
loftiest walks of literature. “More leisure and fewer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
hours,” she says, “had possibly made me happier,
but my business is to make the best of things as they
are.” She ever made the best of two old and wise
men who professed, in mirth, to make love to her
in all seriousness. The two wise men look, in their
correspondence, like two fools. Lord Bath, the
wiser of the two, looks more of a fool than Doctor
Monsey, and there is something nauseous in the
affected playfulness of the aged lovers, and also in
the equally affected virginal coyness with which
Mrs. Montagu received, encouraged, or put aside their
rather audacious gallantry. Her part in these pseudo
love-passages was born of her charity. It gave the
two old friends pleasure (Lord Lyttelton himself
styled her Ma Donna), and it did no harm to the
good-natured lady. Lord Bath, however, is not to be
compared with such a buffoon as Monsey. His
honest opinion of Mrs. Montagu was, that there
never was and never would be a more perfect being
created than that lady. And Burke said that the
praise was not too highly piled.</p>

<p>It was at this period that Mrs. Montagu first
appeared as an authoress, but anonymously. Of the
“Dialogues of the Dead,” published under Lord
Lyttelton’s name, she supplied three. They are
creditable to her, and are not inferior to those by
my lord, which have been sharply criticised, under
the name of “Dead Dialogues,” by Walpole. In
“Cadmus and Mercury,” the lady shows that
strength of mind, properly applied, is better than
strength of body. There is great display of learning;
Hercules, however, talks like gentle Gilbert
West; and Cadmus, when he says that “actions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
should be valued by their utility rather than their
<i>éclat</i>,” shows a knowledge of French which was
hardly to be expected in him.</p>

<p>If we are surprised at the cleverness of Cadmus,
in speaking French, we cannot but wonder at the
ignorance of Mercury, in the next dialogue, with a
modern fine lady, in not knowing the meaning of
<i>bon ton</i>. But the lady’s description of it is as good
as anything in the comedy of the day. As for the
manners of the period, as far as they regard husbands,
wives, and children, their shortcomings are described
with a hand that is highly effective, if not quite
masterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu seems to think that <i>Ici on parle
Français</i> might be posted upon the banks of the
Styx; for, in the dialogue between Plutarch, Charon,
and a modern bookseller, the first alludes to <i>finesse</i>,
and the second refers to the <i>friseur</i> of Tisiphone.
But Plutarch had met M. Scuderi in the Shades!
On the other hand, he had never heard of Richardson
or Fielding! Nevertheless, the criticisms on
modern fiction and modern vices are, if not ringing
with wit, full of good sense and fine satire. They
could only have come from one who had not merely
read much, but who had thought more: one who
had not only studied the life and society of which
she was a part, but who could put a finger on the
disease and also point out the remedy.</p>

<p>The first and last dialogues are enriched by remarks
which are the result of very extensive reading.
That between Mercury and the modern fine
lady abounds in proofs of the writer’s observation,
and consequently of illustrations of contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
social life. The lady pleads her many engagements,
in bar to the summons of Mercury to cross the Styx.
These are not engagements to husband and children,
but to the play on Mondays, balls on Tuesdays, the
opera on Saturdays, and to card assemblies the rest
of the week, for two months to come. She had
indeed found pleasure weary her when the novelty
had worn off; but “my friends,” she says, “always
told me diversions were necessary, and my doctor
assured me dissipation was good for my spirits. My
husband insisted that it was not; and you know that
one loves to oblige one’s friends, comply with one’s
doctor, and contradict one’s husband.” She will,
however, willingly accompany Mercury, if he will
only wait for her till the end of the season. “Perhaps
the Elysian fields may be less detestable than
the country in our world. Pray have you a fine
Vauxhall and Ranelagh? I think I should not dislike
drinking the Lethe waters when you have a full
season.” This fine lady has not been destitute of
good works. “As to the education of my daughters,
I spared no expense. They had a dancing-master, a
music-master, and a drawing-master, and a French
governess to teach them behaviour and the French
language.” No wonder that Mercury sneered at the
fact that the religion, sentiment, and manners of those
young ladies were to be learnt “from a dancing-master,
music-master, and a chambermaid.” As to
the last, there soon came in less likely teachers
of French to young ladies than French chambermaids.
General Burgoyne makes his Miss Allscrip (in
“The Heiress,” a comedy first played in 1786) remark:
“We have young ladies, you know, Blandish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
boarded and educated, upon blue boards in gold
letters, in every village; with a strolling player for
a dancing-master, and a deserter from Dunkirk to
teach the French grammar.”</p>

<p>The dialogues had a great success. The three
avowedly “by another hand” interested the public,
as the circumstance gave them a riddle to be solved
in their leisure hours. They were attributed to men
of such fine intellect that Mrs. Montagu had every
reason to be delighted at such an indirect compliment.</p>

<p>If her own account is to be taken literally, she had
now, at forty, assumed gravity as a grace and an
adornment. In 1761, she wrote to Mrs. Elizabeth
Carter that, whether in London or in the country,
“I am become one of the most reasonable, quiet,
good kind of country gentlewoman that ever was.”
And she closes another letter to the same lady, in
September of the same year, with the observation,—made
when she was only forty-one, and had but just
accomplished half of a career of which she was already
tired,—“I will own I often feel myself so weary of
my journey through this world, as to wish for more
rest, a quiet Sabbath after my working days; but
when such time shall come, perhaps some painful
infirmity may find my virtue employment; but all
this I leave to Him who knows what is best.”</p>

<p>While the writer was recording this wish and making
this reflection, all England was in a frenzy of
exultation at the accession of the young king, George
III., and all London in feverish excitement at the
coming of a young queen. When, so to speak, the
uproar of festival and congratulation culminated at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the coronation of the young royal couple, the lady
who was weary of life and sighed for a Sabboth of
rest, got into a coach at Fulham at half-past four on
an October morning, and was driven to Lambeth.
With her gay company she was rowed across the
river from Lambeth to the cofferer’s office, whence
she saw the procession go and return, between Westminster
Hall and the Abbey, and owned that it exceeded
her expectations. The return to the Hall was
made, however, in the dark; and, under shadow of
night, the Montagu party were rowed to York Buildings,
where a carriage waited to take them to Fulham.
The lady, stirred by a new sensation, which was followed
by neither fatigue nor indisposition, seemed to
have resumed the spirit of the nymph who used to
take headers into the Mary-le-bone Gardens plunging-bath,
and to be complimented, on her daring, in
ballads, by Lord Dupplin!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the fashionable world flocked to Mrs. Montagu’s
house in Hill Street, in the middle of last century,
the street was not paved, and the road was very
much at the mercy of the weather. To get to the
house was not always an easy matter. When entered,
the visitor found it furnished in a style of which much
was said, and at which the hostess herself laughed.
“Sick of Grecian elegance and symmetry, or Gothick
grandeur and magnificence, we must all seek the barbarious
gaudy <i>goût</i> of the Chinese; and fat-headed
pagods and shaking mandarins bear the prize from
the finest works of antiquity; and Apollo and Venus
must give way to a fat idol with a sconce on his head.
You will wonder I should condemn the taste I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
complied with, but in trifles I shall always conform
to the fashion.”</p>

<p>There were duties connected with her position
which Mrs. Montagu as scrupulously fulfilled. Receiving
and returning visits was “a great devoir.”
Resort to assemblies was a “necessary thing;” the
duty of seeing and being seen was an indispensable
duty; but she had mental resources which enabled
her to pity the “polite world,” which had no way of
driving away ennui but by pleasure. If in Hill Street
she was of “the quality,” as Chesterfield called them,
in the country she was not only what she loved to call
herself, a farmer’s wife, but a political economist. At
Sandleford we see a poor wretch standing at the door
of the mansion. She is hideous from dirt, poverty,
and contagious disease born of both. The lady farmer
was not only charitable but something besides. “I
was very angry with her,” she says, “that she has
lately introduced another heir to wretchedness and
want. She has not half Hamlet’s delicacies on the
question. To be or not to be! The law’s delays are
very puny evils to those her offspring must endure.
The world affords no law to make her rich, and yet
she will increase and multiply over the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p>Throughout the printed letters, continual examples
occur of Mrs. Montagu’s acute observation of character,
and of her happy expression when she described
it. She not only watched closely, but spoke boldly
of the ladies around her, and of their more or less
pretty ways. Thus, Mrs. Montagu saw that all the
ladies courted Doctor Young, the poet, but she was
sure it was only because they had heard he was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
genius, and not that they knew he was one. When
some misses expressed their delight at a particular
ball, she remarked that their delight was probably
increased by the absence of Miss Bladen, who became
Lord Essex’s second countess, and who was not there
to outshine them! “So strong in women,” she said,
“was the desire of pleasing, each would have that
happy power confined to her own person.” It did
not escape her eye that Lady Abercorn and Lady
Townshend, “each determining to have the most wit
of any person in the company, always chose different
parties and different ends of the room.” How gracefully
serene is the portrait of the Duchess of Somerset,
who did what was civil without intending to be
gracious, and who so surprised Mrs. Montagu, in 1749,
because the princely state and pride the duchess had
so long been used to, had “left her such an easiness
of manners.” One of her exceptional touches was
when she described the pious Countess of Huntingdon
as a “well-meaning fanatic.” That must have
been after Gilbert West and Lord Lyttelton had
brought her out of the field of Free Inquirers, and
the Primate of Ireland had made her of the religion
of the Established Church. At that period she would
have placed the church above the law, resembling the
old Scottish woman of the kirk, who, on pronouncing
that to take a walk on the Sabbath was a deadly sin,
was reminded that Jesus himself had walked in the
corn-fields on the Sabbath-day, to which she replied,
“Ah weel, it is as ye say; but I think none the
better o’ him for it!”</p>

<p>Adverting to a wicked saying, that few women
have the virtues of an honest man, Mrs. Montagu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
maintained that a little of the blame thereof falls on
the men, “who are more easily deluded than persuaded
into compliance. This makes the women have recourse
to artifice to gain power, which, as they have
gained by the weakness or caprice of those they
govern, they are afraid to lose by the same kind of
arts addressed to the same kind of qualities; and the
flattery bestowed by the men on all the fair from
fifteen, makes them so greedy of praise that they
most excessively hate, detest, and revile every quality
in another woman which they think can obtain it.”
This is the censure, or judgment, be it remembered,
on Last Century Ladies!</p>

<p>When Mrs. Fielding, to benefit those ladies, wrote
a novel called “The Penitents,” supposed to be the
history of the unhappy fair ones in the Magdalen
House, Mrs. Montagu remarked, hesitatingly, “As
all the girls in England are reading novels, it may be
useful to put them on their guard;” but she adds, decisively,
“If I had a daughter, I should rather trust
her to ignorance and innocence than to the effect of
these cautions!”</p>

<p>Of course, Mrs. Montagu studied the gentlemen
as profoundly as the ladies. As one result, she
gently laughed at Doctor Young’s philosophy, which
brought him to believe that one vice corrects another,
till an animal made up of ten thousand bad
qualities grows to be a social creature tolerable to
live with. Sir William Brown could hardly claim
this toleration, for he had not discovered (said Mrs.
Montagu) that the wisest man in the company is
not always the most welcome, and that people are
not at all times disposed to be informed. Fancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
may easily bring before the reader the sort of conversation
which Mrs. Montagu was able to hold with
Mr. Plunket. She says of it: “Some people reduce
their wit to an impalpable powder, and mix it up in a
rebus; others wrap up theirs in a riddle: but mine
and Mr. Plunket’s certainly went off by insensible
perspiration in small talk.” She was so satisfied
that there was a right place for a wise man to play
the fool in, that she expressed a hope to Gilbert
West (who was turning much of her thought from
this world to the next) and to his wife, that “you
will, both of you, leave so much of your wisdom at
Wickham as would be inconvenient in town.” West
feared that, at Sandleford, she sent invitations to
beaux and belles to fill the vacant apartments of her
mind. She merrily answered, that there was empty
space enough there for French hoops and echoes of
French sentiments; but she also seriously replied,
“There are few of the fine world whom I should
invite into my mind, and fewer still who are familiar
enough there to come unasked.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu hated no man, but she thoroughly
despised Warburton. The way he mauled Shakespeare
by explaining him, excited her scornful
laughter; the way in which he marred Christianity
by defending it, excited much more than angry
contempt. “The levity shocks me, the indecency
displeases me, the <i>grossièreté</i> disgusts me. I love to
see the doctrine of Christianity defended by the
spirit of Christianity.” Bishop Warburton and some
country parsons were equally silly in her mind. Of
a poor riddle, she says, “A country parson could
not puzzle his parish with it, even if he should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
endeavour to explain it in his next Sunday’s sermon.
Though I have known some of them explain a thing
till all men doubted it.”</p>

<p>From the rule by which she measured all men, she
did not except any one of her brothers: and never
did sister love her brothers more tenderly and
reasonably. Her brother William, the clergyman,
was restless in temper from excess of love of ease.
“My brother Robinson,” she wrote to her sister,
Mrs. Scott, in 1755, “is emulating the great Diogenes
... he flies the delights of London, and leads
a life of such privacy and seriousness, as looks to
the beholders like wisdom, but, for my part, no life of
inaction deserves that name.” Other characters she
strikes off in a single sentence. That referring to
Sir Charles Williams is a very good sample from an
overflowing measure. “Sir Charles,” she said, “is
still so flighty, that had he not always been a wit, he
would still pass for a madman!” When she refers
to Lord Hyde’s printed, but never acted comedy,
“The Mistakes, or the Happy Resentment,” and
says, “I suppose you will read the play, as it
is by so great a man,” she was probably thinking
of Miss Tibbs, who, “it is well known, always
showed her good breeding by devoting all her
attention to the people of highest rank in the company.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was as clever at generalities as
when sketching individuals and special peculiarities.
The numerous Jews at Tunbridge Wells, in 1745,
she describes as having “worse countenances than
their friend Pontius Pilate in a bad tapestry-hanging.”
Good farmer’s wife as she said of herself, and also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
very fond of refined luxury, she laughed in her letters
at those persons who built palaces in gardens of
beauty, and left, as she said, nothing rude and waste
but their minds; nothing harsh and unpolished but
their tempers. To her, no knowledge came amiss.
Amid all the gaieties of the life at Bath, she took
interest in the chemistry of every-day life. During
one of her visits, she was initiated into the mysteries
of making malt!</p>

<p>Her very affectations, as they were called, sprung
from her endowments. Her learning and reading,
and intercourse with scholars and thinkers, furnished
her with extraordinary figures and illustrations that
were applied to very ordinary uses.</p>

<p>Neither Elizabeth Robinson nor Mrs. Montagu
would be so commonplace as to say the moon shone,
but “the silver Cynthia held up her lamp in the
heavens.” She could readily detect and denounce
this learned affectation, this sacrifice of the natural to
the classical in others; and she said with truth of
Hammond’s “Elegies,” “They please me much, but
between you and me, they seem to me to have something
of a foreign air. Had the poet read Scotch
ballads oftener, and Ovid and Tibullus less, he had
appeared a more natural writer and a more tender
lover.” These terse sayings are well worth collecting.
Here is one from a heap that will furnish a
thousand “I own the conversation of a simpleton
is a grievance, but there the disparity of a wise man
and a fool often ends.”</p>

<p>The unpublished letters take up the glorious theme
previous to the last incident named in the published
correspondence. The earliest is from Mrs. Montagu’s
sister, Mrs. Scott, to the wife of their brother,
the Rev. W. Robinson, at Naples. The two sisters,
Elizabeth and Sarah, loved each other with intense
affection. The younger went long by the nickname
of Pea, from her extraordinary likeness to her elder
sister, who used, before Sarah’s unhappy marriage, to
rally her on the obesity of her lovers and her cruelty
in reducing them to consumptiveness and asses’ milk.</p>

<p><i>March 28, 1761.</i> Mrs. Scott to Mrs. Robinson,
Naples.—“The Tories are in high spirits. The
king has declared that, as they are possessed of the
greatest part of the property of the kingdom, they
ought to have a great share in the government, and
accordingly many are taken into place. The king
was asked what orders he would have given to the
dockmen against the approaching election. His
Majesty answered, ‘No orders at all.’ He would
have them left to themselves. Lord Granville said,
‘That was leaving them to be directed by the First
Lord of the Admiralty’ (Lord Anson). The king
replied, ‘That was true; he had not considered that;
they must, therefore, be told to vote for the Tories,
to be sure.’ The late Speaker and the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
took a most tender farewell of each other. They
thanked and he thanked, and then they re-thanked,
and in short, never were people so thankful on both
sides; and then they recommended him to the king,
to do more than thank him; but he refused any reward.
Only, his son, it is said, will have a pension of
£2,000 per annum—a good, agreeable compliment,
and yet what no one will disapprove.”</p>

<p>Walpole describes Onslow’s retirement, after holding
the office of Speaker during thirty years, in
five successive Parliaments, in these words: “The
Speaker has taken leave and received the highest
compliments, and substantial ones, too. He did not
overact, and it was really a handsome scene. Onslow
accepted a pension of £3,000 a year for his own life
and that of his son—afterward Lord Onslow.”</p>

<p>After noticing the changes in the ministry, and
conferring of honours on, and the granting of pensions
to persons of no great public importance, Mrs.
Scott turns to the death of the great master of the
ceremonies at Bath, Beau Nash, and to the conduct
of the great statesman, Mr. Pitt. “Mr. Nash, I believe,
died since I wrote to you, and all his effects are
to be sold for the benefit of his creditors, but will not
prove sufficient to pay his debts. Collett now officiates
as his successor, though others are talked of for
that noble post; but as neither the corporation nor
the keeper of the rooms seem disposed to annex any
salary to it, I imagine Collett will continue in possession;
for I think no one else will do it without other
reward than the honour and profit arising therefrom.”</p>

<p>Collett, after brief possession of the post so long
held by Nash, was succeeded by Derrick, an adventurer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
in whom Bath was as much interested as England
was in Pitt, of whom Mrs. Scott thus writes: “Mr.
Pitt still continues in his post. Without connections
of any sort, without the power of conferring honours
or places, he commands imperiously, and forces obedience
from mere superiority of parts and integrity.
As a statesman he is self-existent, and depends on
none, nor has any dependent on him. He does not
see his oldest friends but when they have business to
impart, obliges none by private benefits, nor engages
any by social intercourse. His mind seems too great
for any object less than a whole nation. There is
something very new and extremely surprising in his
conduct. He is an Almanzor in politicks. He is himself
alone. How long he can stand thus, only time
can show. As there was scarcely ever an instance of
the like, we have no precedents by which to form conjectures.
National prejudices about Scotchmen are
lulled asleep. Lord Bute is high in favour; the city
is pleased with him; the Tories much attached to him.
The king is still generally applauded. Our sex went
in such numbers to the House of Lords at the closing
of the session, to see his Majesty on the throne, that
good part of the company fainted away, and not above
three lords had room to sit down....</p>

<p>“My brother Matt is at present prosecuting the
minister of Lyminge for non-residence, in revenge for
some offence he has given him about the tithes; and
my father bids fair for being engaged in prosecuting
a clergyman at Canterbury, for saying he was in the
Rebellion in the year ’16.... Report says that the
Duchess of Richmond and some other ladies, whose
husbands are going or gone to Germany, are going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
there likewise, and are to be at Brunswick. I much
question whether their husbands will rejoice in their
company, but certainly Prince Ferdinand will not be
fond of such auxiliaries. It is the oddest party of
pleasure I ever heard of. Thomas Diaforus, who
invites his mistress to the lively amusement of making
one at a dissection, would be an agreeable lover
to these ladies.... Perhaps they think Germany
may afford them more of their husbands’ company
than they can obtain in England; for some among
them would think that a valuable acquisition, and
possibly they may not be mistaken, for a drum that
leads to battle may not be so powerful a rival to a
wife as one that leads its followers only to coquetry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott’s reference to Pitt, secretary of state
and soul of the ministry, of which the old imbecile
Duke of Newcastle was the nominal head, seems to
have been made with Almanzor’s lines in her memory.</p>

</div>

<p>The public mind, however, was not so much occupied
with men of mark as with a ceremony which had
not been witnessed in England for very many years.
In a letter from Batheaston, September 14, 1761,
written by Mrs. Scott to her sister-in-law, at Naples,
she describes the time as one of general madness,
and continues as follows:</p>

<p>“One would imagine that no king had ever married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
or any state ever had a queen before. The
nation has for some time been and will still longer be
absolutely frantic. The expected princess was to
be all perfection, both in person and mind, and I
believe few ever took so much pleasure in the possession
of their own wives as they have in his Majesty’s
having obtained so rare a blessing. I don’t think so
great a compliment has been paid to matrimony for
many years past. Miss Arnold, who is gone up to
my brother Morris, in order to be ready for the coronation,
has had a sight of her Majesty; and from
her, as well as others, I understand she is very far
from handsome. Her mouth fills a great part of her
face. When Miss Arnold saw her, which was only
in passing, she was talking and laughing, which would
shew it in its full dimensions, and she says she could
see no other feature; but we are assured she is
extremely good-natured, very lively, and has an extraordinary
understanding. The first part, her youth
renders probable; for the last article, we may rather
suppose it affords a reasonable ground for expectation
than that it has come to any perfection. She has
been learning French since she knew she was to leave
Mecklenburgh; and I suppose must have endeavoured
to obtain some English, as the more necessary thing.
It is said that Lord Hardwicke wrote over an account
to his wife of her personal defects, which her ladyship
read in a large company. This was repeated to
his Majesty, who is greatly offended. Certainly, it
was highly imprudent in the one, and not less foolish
in the other; and I wonder his lordship, after having
been married near thirty years, should not know his
wife better than to put it in her power to commit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
such a folly, as he might have known how likely she
was to use it to his disadvantage. I suppose the
poor man went over in full expectation of seeing a
Venus, and was so amazed that he could not contain
his disappointment.</p>

<p>“As many persons as Greenwich would hold waited
there for many days to see her Majesty arrive, and at
last, after having been exposed to those storms, she
landed in Suffolk, and, consequently, did not make
her appearance on the Thames. The rooms at
Greenwich let for half a guinea a day, and the poorest
little casement brought in the owner a daily crown.
I hope it has enriched many poor people. Of all the
taxes ever levied in this kingdom, that which will be
raised this year on folly will be by far the highest.
I hear there is scaffolding enough erected against the
coronation to hold two millions of people. Almost all
the kingdom will be in London; and many, I suppose,
will be reduced to scanty meals for a whole year to
come, by the expenses on this occasion; and if the
day should prove rainy, which the season of the year
renders very probable, those who are not in Westminster
Hall or the Abbey will see nothing; for there
is an awning prepared, to be carried over the heads
of those who walk in the procession, in case of rain.
The finery of every one who intends to appear at
court is beyond imagination. This kingdom, or perhaps
any other, scarcely ever saw the like.</p>

<p>“The queen’s clothes are so heavy that, by all accounts,
if she be not very robust, she will not be able
to move under the burden; but I hope her constitution
is not very delicate, for she did not arrive in
London till three o’clock; and, besides the fatigue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
of her journey, with the consequences of the flutter
she could not avoid being in, she was to dress for
her wedding, be married, have a Drawing-room, and
undergo the ceremony of receiving company, after
she and the king were in bed, and all the night after
her journey and so long a voyage. Nothing but a
German constitution could have undergone it.” ...</p>

<p>Poor Queen Charlotte’s plainness was—as Northcote
subsequently described it, in speaking of her
portrait by Reynolds, namely—an elegant, and not
a vulgar plainness. She had a beautifully shaped
arm, and was fond of exhibiting it. “She had a fan
in her hand,” said Northcote; “Lord! how she held
that fan!” Of literary news this letter contains the
following item:</p>

<p>“... Doctor Young has written a poem on
‘Resignation,’ and dedicated it to Mrs. Boscawen.
I have not seen it, but have heard it much praised,
and am told he wrote it at the desire of my sister
Montagu and Miss Carter, who requested it in a visit
they made him on their road to Tunbridge, where my
sister spent the summer.”</p>

<p>Municipal authorities, more gallant than Mrs. Scott
and the female critics, spoke of the queen, in their
addresses, as “amiably eminent for the beauties of
her mind and person.” Many parties who drove into
town to witness the coronation, were made to “stand
and deliver” their valuables by highwaymen, who infested
all the roads leading into London. Those who
escaped and got as far as Charing Cross, could go no
further, unless the gentlemen fought way for their
ladies and themselves, which some bold spirits ventured
to do. While the great show was in progress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
press-gangs picked up youths likely, however unwilling,
to serve the king; and the city at night was
in the hands of a mob, which did with London, Londoners,
and their possessions very much as they
pleased. Many lives were sacrificed, and very little
was thought of them.</p>

<p>The night after the wedding, there was a ball at
court, so grand that nothing like it, so it was said,
had ever been seen in England. The king and queen
retired at the early hour of eleven. One great feature
of the night was that the Duke of Ancaster, whose
wife was mistress of the robes to the queen, appeared
in the dress which the king had worn the whole day
before at the coronation, and which his Majesty had
condescendingly given to his Grace! A pleasanter
feature was to be seen in the group of bridesmaids,
who “danced in the white-boddiced coats they had
worn at the wedding.” Liquor and illuminations prevailed
outside. “Ah!” said an observant Smithfield
dealer; “what with plays, fairs, pillories, and executions,
London has more holidays than there are red
days in the almanack!” In truth, London was drunk
and rampant. It could be both at small outlay; for
mutton was selling at one shilling a stone (in the
carcase), and cognac could be had for nine shillings
a gallon!</p>

<p>Lord Hardwicke, named in the above letter, was
the son of an attorney, and rose to the dignity of
lord chancellor by his merits. When he was plain
Philip Yorke, he made an offer of marriage to an
heiress, a young widow, with a jointure, whose father
asked him for his rent-roll! The handsome barrister
replied that he had “a perch of ground in Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Hall.” The young fellow’s suit prevailed; and
the happy couple began life in a small house near
Lincoln’s Inn, the ground floor of which served for
the husband’s offices. The lady was connected with
the family of Gibbon the historian; and she was a
wife so good, prudent, and so wise, that Mrs. Scott’s
sneer at her seems quite gratuitous. The poor lady
died three days before the coronation; and her husband
in 1764.</p>

<p>Doctor Young’s “Resignation” was the dying song
of a man above fourscore. Its object was to console
Mrs. Boscawen for the loss of her heroic husband,
the admiral. In the last century, English heroes
were singularly respected. The Suffolk ladies, of
whatever rank, voluntarily yielded precedence to Mrs.
Vernon, “great Admiral Vernon’s” wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt resigned the foreign secretaryship on
October 5, 1761. He and his friends were for declaring
war against Spain. Lord Bute and a majority
opposed it, the king agreeing with them. Pitt’s fall
was made tolerable by the pension of £3,000 a year
for the lives of himself, son, and wife. The latter was
created Baroness of Chatham; and in three months
war was declared with Spain!</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott to her brother at Naples. <i>November 28,
1761.</i>—“... Lord Bath and Lord Lyttelton were
both at Tunbridge, and Miss Carter was with my
sister; so, you may imagine, the place was agreeable,
and wit flowed more copiously than the spring. The
room she has so long been fitting-up is not yet finished,
but the design of it is so much improved that I really
believe it will be the most beautiful thing ever seen,
and proportionably expensive. Taste, you know, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
not the cheapest thing to purchase. Use and convenience
may be provided for at a moderate charge,
but great geniuses are above being contented with
such matters.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have heard much of the general
lamentations for Mr. Pitt’s resignation. It is by
many thought that his resuming his post is unavoidable,
and, indeed, I suppose it must be so, if affairs
take the turn which appearances give reason to expect.
He is more popular than ever in the city.
The procession of the royal family on the Lord
Mayor’s Day was broke in a manner that puzzled
people much, as they could not account for it; but
it has since been said it was occasioned by a multitude
of sailors, who forced their way through the
crowd in search of Mr. Pitt’s chariot, from which
they intended to have taken the horses, and to have
drawn it themselves to the Mansion House. The
post of honour is not often a place of safety, but I
think it was seldom more dangerous than it would
have proved in this case, had they effected their
design; but they could not find him, so he got there
with whole bones, and was received with greater acclamations
than were bestowed on any other person.
He endeavoured to get away privately, but the mob
were so very kind that they very near overturned
Lord Temple’s chariot, in which he was, by crowding
about it, and hanging on the doors; and a very long
time he was in getting home. I will not say it was
tedious, for the sweetest music is deserved praise.
He did not attend the House of Commons till some
days after its first meeting; but when he did, spoke,
by all accounts, beyond what he or any other man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
ever did, with perfect calmness and modesty, and,
with few words, silenced every one who endeavoured
to oppose him. G. Grenville attempted to answer
him, but a general buz obliged him to sit down.
However, the press is loaded with his abuse. These
events are happy for hireling scribblers. They get
a dinner, and can do him no essential harm. So
it’s very well. It would be cruel to grudge them
their morsel. I hope it will fatten many a starving
author.</p>

<p>“But to mention those who do not write for bread,
and those who contrive to get both bread and fame
together, Lord Lyttelton’s second volume quarto of
‘Henry the Second,’ is in the press.... Mallett has
published a poem called ‘Truth in Rhyme,’ dedicated
to Lord Bute.... I am glad he can tell truth in
either rhyme or prose.... I have heard a <i>bon mot</i>
of Lady Townshend’s, of which no one will deny the
truth. Somebody expressed their surprise that Lady
Northumberland should be made lady of the bedchamber.
‘Surely,’ said she, ‘nothing could be more
proper. The queen does not understand English,
and can anything be more necessary than that she
should learn the vulgar tongue?’”</p>

<p>It was at this period that Mrs. Scott became an
authoress, in whole or in part, of a successful, but
now utterly forgotten, novel, called “Millennium
Hall.” This book, a single volume, went through
four editions. In the first edition, 1762, the first
word of the title is spelt throughout with one <i>n</i>, and
in all the editions it is said to be by a gentleman on
his travels. Common report assigned the authorship
to Mrs. Scott, shared, as far as some small help went,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
by her friend and companion for years, Lady Barbara
Montagu. A copy of the second edition (1764),
which once belonged to Horace Walpole, is now in
the British Museum. On the back of the title-page,
Walpole corrects the above sharing of literary labour
in the following words, written in his well-known
hand: “This book was written by Lady Bab Montagu
(the sister of George Montagu Dunk, Earl of
Hallifax) and Mrs. Scott, daughter of Matthew Robinson,
Esq., and wife of George Scott, Esq.” It was
continued to be published as the work of a gentleman,
in the two succeeding editions; but Mrs. Scott
is still accredited with the greatest share in the
labour. “Millennium Hall” is generally described
as a novel. It is a series of stories of the romantic
lives of four or five ladies who, having been bitterly
disappointed in love, and handsomely solaced by
riches, retire from the world and establish themselves
in the hall which gives its name to the novel. It is a
name which would lead one to suppose that there is
a sort of millennium peace and happiness achieved
there, such as will be found on earth generally only
in the millennium period. The wealthy and love-lorn
ladies of the hall, however, have only founded a
female school and society in advance of contemporary
ideas, but having nothing wonderful, though now and
then something eccentric, if weighed by our present
standards. The real interest of the volume lies in
the romantic biographies, and these are narrated with
ladylike grace, elegance, tenderness, and, occasionally,
tedious prolixity.</p>

<p>The story represented, with some exaggeration,
the lives led by Lady Bab and Mrs. Scott in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
“conventual house” at Batheaston. Both boys and
girls were well trained by those ladies at that place.
Mrs. Montagu, in reference to Mrs. Scott’s good
works, so loved her sister as to render her uncharitable
to other people. “Methodist ladies,” she said,
“did out of enthusiasm what Mrs. Scott did out of a
calm sense of duty, and gratitude that the employment
was a solace to one who had been cruelly tried
by affliction.” No credit was given to poor Lady
Bab, but her happy temperament could well afford to
do without it. Strange as the stories were which
illustrate “Millennium Hall,” they were not nearly
so strange as one which, in March, 1762, Mrs. Scott
related to her brother at Rome, in a letter from Bath:
“Those who deal in the small wares of scandal will
not want subjects. Miss Hunter, daughter to Orby
Hunter, has lately furnished a copious topic....
She and Lord Pembroke, in spite of winds, waves,
and war, left this kingdom for one where they imagined
they may love with less molestation,—where
they cannot see a wife weep nor hear a father rage.
They set off in a storm better suited to travelling
witches than flying lovers, but were so impeded by
the weather, that a captain sent out a boat and took
the lady prisoner; but after he had set her on shore,
he found that, as she was of age, it was difficult to
assume any lawful authority over her; and, after
having spent a night in tears and lamentation, she
was restored to Lord Pembroke.... His lordship
resigned his commission and his place of lord of the
bedchamber, and wrote a letter to Lady Pembroke,
acknowledging her charms and virtues and his own
baseness (an unnecessary thing, since the latter she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
must long have known, and was probably not absolutely
ignorant of the former), but assuring her Miss
Hunter was irresistible; that he never intended to
return into England, and had taken care that £5,000
should be paid her yearly. As Lady Pembroke is so
handsome and amiable, perhaps his conduct will be
seen by the world in a true light, without any fashionable
palliations. A report was spread, that they were
taken by a privateer, but I can hear of none but of a
very different capture—the clay cold corpses of Lord
and Lady Kingstone, which were on their way to
England for interment.”</p>

<p>The elopement of Miss Hunter (a maid of honour,
too!) from Bath with the Earl of Pembroke formed
one of the most delicious bits of scandal ever discussed
in the Rooms, on the Parade, or in the Meadows.
The excitement attendant thereon was shared by the
whole country; for Kitty Hunter was a well-known,
and not at all suspected, beauty of the day. Her
father, Orby Hunter, was, at the time of the elopement,
one of the lords of the admiralty. The vessel
that brought back the fugitives was a privateer, commanded
by a friend of Mr. Hunter’s. Kitty’s father
declined to receive her, and she accompanied Lord
Pembroke abroad. The earl was a married man.
His wife was Elizabeth, daughter of the Duke of
Marlborough. Her exemplary husband wrote to her
from Italy a letter, in which he politely informed her,
that though he had lived with her so many years, he
regretted to say he had never been able to love her
so well as she deserved, so thought it best to leave
her. Subsequently, he had the assurance to invite
Lady Pembroke to accompany them on the Continent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
“And she,” says Walpole, “who is all gentleness and
tenderness, was with difficulty withheld from acting
as mad a part from goodness as he had acted from
guilt and folly.” He had tried to make his wife hate
him, but in vain. It is one of the illustrations of
social feeling in the last century, that neither the
rascal earl nor the light-o’-love maid of honour was
thought much the worse of for their shameless conduct.
A “Peerage,” of ten years subsequent to the
elopement, edited by a clergyman, too! the Rev.
Frederick Barlow, vicar of Burton, thus speaks of my
lord, who was then living: “His lordship distinguished
himself in the annals of gallantry with Miss
H—— about ten years ago, and since that time,” it,
goes on to speak plainly of the earl’s gallantry, “with
several ladies of less note;” adding, “his lordship is
universally esteemed as an accomplished nobleman
and a brave officer.” Mrs. Scott happily goes on to
treat of a plainer but much honester woman than
Kitty Hunter: “The queen gives daily less satisfaction,
and the people who at first found her out to
be pleasing, seem now to be insensible to the discovery
they then made. Her husband, however,
seems fond of her.... Report says the Prince of
Mecklenburg, a very pretty sort of man, with an
agreeable person, is fallen desperately in love with
Miss Bowes—a prudent passion; and the girl has
no ambition if she does not choose to be a princess.
I fancy, should she become such, he would be richer
than the duke, his elder brother.... Lady Raymond
is going to be married to Lord Robert Bertie,—an
union wherein no acid will enter; for they are
both famed for good temper. Mr. Whitehead’s play<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
has been acted and published, and a poor performance
it is. The dialogue flat and ungenteel, and the plot
poor enough.”</p>

<p>Whitehead’s play was a comedy, “The School for
Lovers,” in which Garrick played Sir John Dorilant.
The main attraction was the ever youthful Mrs. Cibber,
who, at nearly fifty years old, acted Cælia, a girl
of seventeen; yet Victor says: “She was admitted
by the nicest observers to become the character.
This was entirely owing to that uncommon symmetry
and exact proportion in her form, that happily remained
with her to her death.” But there were
more extraordinary comedies being enacted in real
life than on the stage.</p>

<p>In a letter from Mrs. Scott to her brother, at
Naples, dated April 10, 1762, there are profuse congratulations
on the birth of his son, and a wonderful
amount of speculation on mothers, nurses, and on
babies generally, possible and impossible, expected
and not expected, overtardy or too hasty, and all in
as plain language as the subject could admit. The
writer then refers to the report of the queen affording
promise of an heir; “but as she is no great favourite
with the nation, it does not seem to afford any great
joy.” This leads to a subject that made a stir among
last century ladies who were privileged to go to court.
“A court dress (<i>sic</i>) is going to take place at St.
James’s, the same as in France, which greatly distresses
the old ladies, who are quite clamourous on
the occasion, and at a loss how to cover so much
neck as the stiffened-bodied gowns are made to show,
and which they are sensible is not very <i>appétissante</i>
after a certain age; as likewise how to supply the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
deficiency which churlish time has made in their
once flowing tresses. Some younger ladies, to whom
nature has been rather a stepdame than a kind
mother, join in their lamentations, and London is in
an uproar. The exultation of those who, conscious
of their charms, rejoice in laying aside as much covering
as possible, being as little silent at the distress
of the others. They look on this allowed display as
a sort of jail delivery to their long-imprisoned attractions;
and as beauty is nature’s boast, insist that it
should be showed at courts, and feasts and high solemnities,
where most may wonder at the workmanship;
and that fashion has been hitherto unjust in
concealing part of the superiority nature has bestowed
upon them. The consumption of pearl-powder will
certainly be much increased; for where there is such
a resource, even fourscore will exhibit a snowy breast,
and the corpulent dowagers will unite the lilies of the
spring with all the copious abundance of a later
season.</p>

<p>“... Lord Pembroke, after he got to Holland,
wrote to his lady, to desire her to come to them,
assuring her Miss Hunter would be assiduous in her
endeavours to oblige her, and that they should form
a very happy society, if she would bring over her
guitar, two servants who play on the French horn,
and his dog Rover! This polite invitation she,
Emma like, was exceeding ready to comply with, but
the Duke of Marlborough had rather too much sense
to permit it. His lordship has since written her
word, he shall never be happy till he lives with her
again. Absurd as all this is, it is certainly fact, and
some add, that he has advised Miss Hunter to turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
nun! To be sure he best knows how fit she is to
take a vow of chastity! That he may by this time
wish she would take any vow that might separate her
from him, is, I think, very probable.”</p>

<p>The general scramble for honours which usually
marks a new reign had not yet ceased. Mrs. Scott
thus refers to the part which some of her own family
took in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott to the Reverend W. Robinson. <i>May
26, 1762.</i>—“I cannot forbear wishing you could have
an Irish bishopric, but your profession are too watchful
to suffer such things to be vacant. I hear our
cousin Robinson does not much like his promotion to
Kildare. I suppose he does not entirely relish rising
step by step. All travelling is expensive, and I believe
none more so than the passing through the various
stages of bishoprics; but I think he may be
contented to rise <i>à petits pas</i>. His rising at all seems
to proceed only from a want of anything to stop him,
according to the philosophical axiom, that put a thing
in motion and it will move for ever, if it meets with
nothing to obstruct its course. Nature went but a
slow pace when she made him, and did not jump into
one perfection. Sir Septimus is tolerably contented
with his fate in a world so regardless of real merit,
and therefore little likely to reward his superlative
merits. I hear that a week before he had this black
rod given him (a proper reward for a preceptor), he
declared that whoever would eat goose at court must
swallow the feathers; but now they have been so
well stroked down, he finds them go down easily
enough.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent letter to her sister-in-law at Naples,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Mrs. Scott lightly sketches a celebrated character at
Bath.</p>

<p>“This place is by no means full, but it contains
much wealth. Colonel Clive, the Nabob maker (is
not that almost as great a title as the famous Earl of
Warwick’s?), lives at Westgate House, with all the
Clives about him. He has sold his possessions in
India to the East India Company for £30,000 per
annum, a trifling sum, which he dedicates to the buying
of land. In a time when property is so fluctuating,
I think he may see himself possessor of the
whole kingdom, should his distempers allow him a
long life; but his health is bad, and he purposes,
when peace is made, at latest, to show at Rome the
richest man in Europe. He lives in little pomp;
moderate in his table, and still more so in equipage
and retinue.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott now disappears for awhile, to make way
for her more celebrated sister.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

</div>

<p>The first letter of Mrs. Montagu’s in the hitherto
unpublished series is addressed “To Mr. Robinson,”
the writer’s brother. It is dated from “London, 28th
of May, 1762.” Mr. Robinson was then residing at
Naples, where his wife had recently given birth to a
son. After the usual congratulations, Mrs. Montagu
says: “I would have answered your letter the
day after I received it, but was obliged to wait for the
letter of recommendation to Mr. Pitt. Neither Lord
Lyttelton or the Bishop of Carlisle are related to or
acquainted with Mr. Pitt. Their sister married a
distant cousin of Mr. George Pitt’s, and was parted
from him, I believe, long before Mr. George Pitt was
a man, and they have not ever had the least commerce
with him.” After this explanation, the writer
refers to the news of the day, and to one of the leading
men of the time: “The Duke of Newcastle is
about to resign his office and retire to the joys of
private life. I am afraid he will find that the mind
used to business does not find quiet in idleness.
There is hardly a greater misfortune than to have the
mind much accustomed to the tracasseries of the
world. A country gentleman can amuse himself by
angling in a trout-stream, or venturing his neck in a
fox-chase; a studious man can enjoy his books in
solitude, and, with tranquill pleasure, ‘woo lone quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
in her silent walk;’ but chiefs out of war and statesmen
out of place, like all animals taken out of their
proper climate, make a miserable affair of rural life.
I dare say his Grace of Newcastle will fall to serpentizing
rivers, and then wish himself again a fisher of
men. Aurora may put on her finest robe to unbar
the gates of Morn; he will still sigh that his folding
doors are not open to a crowded levée. The notes
of Philomel are not sweet to ears used to flattery;
and what is the harvest home to a man used to collect
the treasure of England?</p>

<p>“The king has purchased Buckingham House, and
is going to fit it up elegantly for his retired
hours. Her majesty promises to give us an heir
very soon. Princess Amelia has purchased Gunnersbury
House. The Duke of Portland died about ten
days ago, and the Duke of Manchester last week.</p>

<p>“There has been a cold and fever in town, as universal
as a plague, but, thank God! less fatal. Mr.
Montagu had it violently, and we had ten servants
sick at the same time. This distemper is not yet
over. It grows more fatal, but I hope we shall have
some rain, which will probably put a stop to it....
My poor friend Mrs. Donellan dyed of it the day before
yesterday. She had been ill all the winter, and
was unable to struggle with a new distemper....
We propose to go to Sandleford very soon, and I hope
to have my sister Scott’s company there, which will
make me very happy. Lady Bab Montagu has lost
her sister, Lady Charlotte Johnson, who dyed in
childbed.</p>

<p>“Lord Hallifax is returned with great glory from his
Lord Lieutenancy in Ireland. He pleased all people;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
he united all parties; he contented those he was sent
by and those he was sent to; and has shown it is
possible to please the government and to be popular
there.... I suppose you have heard of the death
of Sir Edward Dering, which was sudden. He has
entailed everything on his grandson, and left but very
small fortune to his younger children. People seem
to think that by making one person in their family
rich, they can make one very happy; but alas! human
happiness cannot be carried beyond a certain pitch.
Competency will make every one easy: great wealth
cannot make any one happy. It is strange, parents
should seem to feel only for one child, or, indeed,
that the heir should be dearer than the child; for it
is as heir they show their regards to one of the family.
No personal merit, no tender attachment, no
sympathy of disposition can overrule that circumstance.
Sir Edward Dering dyed very rich....</p>

<p>“Mr. Harrison’s watch” (the fourth and most perfect
time-keeper, for ascertaining the longitude at sea,
invented by the Yorkshire carpenter’s son, by which
he ultimately received £24,000) “has succeeded beyond
expectation; navigation will be improved by it,
which all who have the spirit of travelling shall rejoice
at. The wives of some of our general officers are
gone to Lisbon with their husbands, which I tell you
for the honour of the fair sex. Lord Anson is in a
very bad state of health. I am told Rome is the best
place so get books at; I should be glad to have Muratori
‘Sopra le cose delli secoli passi.’ I have his
‘Annals of Italy.’ ... My love to my sister and dear
little godson.... Pray remember, you owe me a
goddaughter still.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Scott’s letter in June, to Mr. W. Robinson,
has two passages in it which are like notes to her sister’s
epistle.</p>

<p>“You will find few commoners in England. We
make nobility as fast as people make kings and
queens on Twelfth Night, and almost as many....
Lady Townshend says, she dare not spit out of her
window for fear of spitting on a lord.”</p>

<p>“.... The Duke of Newcastle, after his resignation,
had a very numerous levée, but somebody observed
to him, there were but two bishops, present.
He is said to have replied, that bishops like other
men, were too apt to forget their maker. I think
this has been said for him, or the resignation of power
has much brightened his understanding; for of whatever
he may be accused, the crime of wit was never
laid to his charge.”</p>

<p>Walpole states, with regard to the prelates at the
old duke’s levée: “As I suppose all bishops are
prophets, they foresee that he will never come into
place again; for there was but one that had the decency
to take leave of him, after crowding his rooms
for forty years together: it was Cornwallis.” The
duke went out on finding he had no chance of carrying
a pecuniary aid to Prussia. If he was almost a
fool, as some kind friends said, he had the wisdom to
keep in place longer than any of his contemporaries.
He was succeeded as Prime Minister by Lord Bute.
Cornwallis, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, reaped
the reward of his fidelity. He was promoted to the
Archbishopric of Canterbury in 1768. It should be
added to the honour of the duke, who, however mentally
ill-endowed and eccentric, was a gentleman in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
practice, that he declined a pension on his retirement.
He might be incapable of serving his country, he said,
but England should certainly not find him a burthen.
Chesterfield cites, as an example of his timidity, the
duke’s childish fear at Lord Chesterfield’s bill for correcting
the calendar, and, as a proof of his integrity,
the fact that “he retired from business above four
hundred thousand pounds poorer than when he
engaged in it.”</p>

<p>The duke left “business” in a considerable amount
of confusion. In a letter dated July 27, 1762, Mrs.
Scott writes to Mr. Robinson at Rome, after much
small talk on babies and jokes on prophesied lyingsin,
in these words:</p>

<p>“Political disputes never ran so high in print as at
present. The periodical papers are numerous and
abusive to the greatest degree. By what I hear, the
lawyers find it some substitution for the decay of business
in the courts; for the minority papers regularly
undergo the inspection of council learned in the law
before they are published, that the authors who stand
on the very verge of treason may not, by some inadvertency,
make a <i>faux pas</i> that will throw them down
the precipice; and some persons of consequence are
under engagements to the printer to indemnify him
should the heavy hand of authority oppress him....</p>

<p>“... The king has given Johnson a pension of
£300 per annum,—a necessary step for one who
wishes to be thought the patron of literature, and
what every one must approve.”</p>

<p><i>The North Briton</i> was not of Mrs. Scott’s opinion
with regard to Johnson’s merits. “I hope,”
says Wilkes (No. 11, August 14th), “Johnson is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
writer of reputation, because, as a writer, he has just
got a pension of £300 per annum. I hope, too, that
he has become a friend to this constitution and the
family on the throne, now he is thus nobly provided
for; but I know he has much to unwrite, more to
unsay, before he will be forgiven by the true friends
of the present illustrious family for what he has been
writing and saying for many years.”</p>

<p>In the last-named month, occurred that great
event, the birth of “the first gentleman in Europe.”
Mrs. Scott thus speaks of mother and child:</p>

<p><i>August 13, 1762.</i> Mrs. Scott to Mrs. Robinson,
Rome.—“On Thursday, the queen was brought to
bed of a son, and both, we are told, are well. Many
rejoiced, but none more than those who have been
detained during all this hot weather in town to be
present at the ceremony. Among them, no one was
more impatient than the Chancellor, who, not considering
any part of the affair as a point of law,
thought his presence very unnecessary. His lordship
and the Archbishop must have had a fatiguing
office; for, as she was brought to bed at 7 in the
morning, they must have attended her labour all
night, for fear they should be absent at the critical
moment of delivery. I wish they were not too much
out of humour before the prince was born, to be able
to welcome it properly.... The lady’s person is not
the only thing that displeased. There is a coarseness
and vulgarity of manners that disgust much
more. She does not seem to choose to fashion herself
at all.... Ned Scott’s wife is to suckle the
Prince of Wales—an employment which in all
probability will prove as good nourishment to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
own family as to the royal babe; for her numerous
offspring can scarcely fail of being provided for after
she has served in such an office.</p>

<p>“... Peace is being much talked of, tho’ the
terms are unknown. The Duke of Bedford is
spoken of as the person who is to go to Paris to
transact it. I hope much will not depend on secret
articles; for I think he gave a proof, when old Bussy
was here, that his old nurse could not be a greater
blab!”</p>

<p>The chancellor who was present on the above
occasion was “cursing Lord Northington,”—a
coarse, witty man, married to a fool, who became
the mother of the witty Lady Bridget Fox Lane.
Northington, like Newcastle, had his fling at the
bishops. In serious illness, he was counselled to
send for a certain prelate. “He will never do,” said
the patient. “I should have to confess that I
committed my heaviest sin when I made him a
bishop!” The primate who attended at the birth of
the Prince of Wales was Secker; and as he was
originally a dissenter, and was never baptised in the
Church of England, there were anxious church-women
who thought that his christening George
Prince of Wales would never make a Christian of
him. And it can’t be said that it did! Meanwhile,
how things were otherwise going in England, Mrs.
Scott relates to her brother, in Rome, in a letter
dated September, 1762.</p>

<p>“The lowest artificer thinks now of nothing but
the constitution of the government.... The English
always seemed born politicians, but were never
so universally mad on the subject as at present. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
you order a mason to build an oven, he immediately
inquires about the progress of the peace, and descants
on the preliminaries. A carpenter, instead of
putting up a shelf to a cupboard, talks of the Princess
Dowager, of Lord Treasarre, and of secretaries of
state. Neglected lie the trowel and the chisel; the
mortar dries and the glue hardens while the persons
who should use them are busied with dissertations on
the government.</p>

<p>“... The Duke of Marlborough and Lady Caroline
Russell were married eight and forty hours after
his grace declared himself a lover. The Duke of
Bedford was always known to be a man of business,
but he never despatched a matter quicker than this.
He gave to Lady Caroline £50,000 down, and is to
give as much more at his death.”</p>

<p>The next letter, written at Sandleford, October
the 8th, 1762, is addressed to the writer’s sister-in-law,
“Mrs. Robinson, Recommendé à Monsieur
Jenkins, Gentilhome Anglois au Caffé Anglois, sur
la Place di Espana, Rome.” It commences with
“My dear Madam,” and after a very prolix argument
on the lack of interest in home news sent to travellers
abroad, Mrs. Montagu refers with pride to the English
triumphs at the Havanna and Martinico, and
thus continues.... “But we are not much the nearer
to a peace; for, as ambition subsides or crouches in
the House of Bourbon, it rises in the Court of Aldermen,
in London. When we shut the Temple of
Janus, we shut up the trade of Change Alley, and the
city finds its account in a war, and they clamour
against any peace that will not give us the commerce
of the whole world!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“We have lately had a very fine public ceremony,
the instalment of the new Knights of the Garter at
Windsor. The king, assuming the throne of sovereign
of the order, gave great lustre to the spectacle.
I should have liked to have seen so august a
ceremony; and my Lord Bath was so good as to ask
me to go to Windsor with him, from his house at
Maidenhead Bridge; but Mr. Montagu, not being
fond of public shows, and apprehending his lordship
offered to go out of complaisance, I declined it, and
my lord spent three days here; so it was plain, his
politeness to us was his only inducement to go to the
instalment. I must own I should have taken some
pleasure in being led back into former ages and the
days of our great Plantagenets. I have a reverence,
too, for the institutions of Chivalry. The qualities
of a Knight were valour, liberality, and courtesy, and
to be <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>. And though the
change of government and manners make this knightly
character now appear a little extravagant, the
Redresser of wrongs was a respectable title before a
regular police and a good system of laws secured the
rights and properties of the weak. I hear the late
instalment was extremely brilliant. The helmets of
the knights were adorned with gems; military honours,
indeed, did not sit proudly on their crests; but
if they have the virtues suited to the times we live
in, we will be contented. The knights of Edward ye
Third were, indeed, very great men. The assembly
of British Worthies might have disputed personal
merit with, perhaps, the greatest Heroes of antiquity,
considering them singly and independently; but to
enjoy an extensive or a lasting fame, men’s actions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
must be tyed to great events; then they swim down
Fate’s innavigable tyde, otherwise, they soon sink
into oblivion.”...</p>

<p>In the February of this year, 1762, Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu had returned to England, after
many years of absence. In October, in the same year,
she died. Of her appearance on her return, Mrs.
Montagu wrote as follows to her sister-in-law at
Naples:</p>

<p><i>February 16, 1762.</i>—“You have lately returned
to us from Italy a very extraordinary personage,
Lady Mary Wortley. When Nature is at the trouble
of making a very singular person, Time does right
in respecting it. Medals are preserved, when common
coin is worn out; and as great geniuses are
rather matters of curiosity than of art, this lady
seems reserved to be a wonder for more than our
generation. She does not look older than when she
went abroad, has more than the vivacity of fifteen,
and a memory which, perhaps, is unique. Several
people visited her out of curiosity, which she did not
like. I visit her because her cousin and mine were
cousin-germans. Though she has not any foolish
partiality for her husband or his relations, I was very
graciously received, and you may imagine entertained,
by one who neither thinks, speaks, acts or dresses
like anybody else. Her domestick is made up of all
nations, and when you get into her drawing-room,
you imagine you are in the first story of the Tower
of Babel. An Hungarian servant takes your name
at the door: he gives it to an Italian, who delivers
it to a Frenchman; the Frenchman to a Swiss, and
the Swiss to a Polander; so that, by the time you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
get to her ladyship’s presence, you have changed your
name five times, without the expense of an act of
parliament.”</p>

<p>In October, the same writer thus wrote of Lady
Mary’s death, and of the son who survived his
mother:</p>

<p>“Lady Mary Wortley Montagu returned to England,
as it were, to finish where she began. I wish
she had given us an account of the events that filled
in the space between. She had a terrible distemper;
the most virulent cancer I ever heard of, which carried
her off very soon. I met her at Lady Bute’s in
June, and she then looked well. In three weeks,
at my return to London, I heard she was given
over. The hemlock kept her drowsy and free from
pain; and the physicians thought if it had been given
early, might possibly have saved her. She left her
son one guinea. He is too much of a sage to be concerned
about money, I presume. When I first knew
him, a rake and a beau, I did not imagine he would
addict himself at one time to Rabbinical learning, and
then travel all over the East, the great Itinerant
Savant of the World. One has read that the believers
in the transmigration of souls suppose a man, who
has been rapacious and cunning, does penance in the
shape of a fox. Another, cruel and bloody, enters
the body of a wolf; but I believe my poor cousin, in
his pre-existent state, having broken all moral laws,
has been sentenced to suffer in all the various characters
of human life. He has run through them all
unsuccessfully enough. His dispute with Mr. Needham
has been communicated to me by a gentleman
of the Museum, and I think he will gain no laurels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
there; but he speaks as decisively as if he had been
bred in Pharaoh’s court, in all the learning of the
Egyptians. He has certainly very uncommon parts,
but too much of the rapidity of his mother’s
genius.</p>

<p>“... I am sure my brother will be glad to hear
that Mrs. Scott, of Scottshall, is wet-nurse to our
Prince of Wales, and is much liked by our king and
royal family; so that I hope she will be able to make
interest to establish all her children. A little of
the royal favour and protection will bring them forward
in professions, and the girls may have little
places in the household; and I hope the scheme
which I forwarded to the utmost of my power, will
save an ancient, honourable family from ruin. She
is vastly pleased and happy in her situation, and her
royal nursling is as fine and healthy a child as
can be.</p>

<p>“... I have rambled a good deal this summer,
much to my amusement and the amendment of Mr.
Montagu’s health, who was greatly out of order in
the spring. We went to Lord Lyttelton’s in Worcestershire,
with a large party consisting of my Lord
Bath, Mr. and Mrs. Vesey, and Doctor Monsey.
Lord Lyttelton had his daughter, his sister, Mrs.
Hood, and the Bishop of Carlisle (his brother) with him,
so we made a pretty round family. The weather was
fine, and the place is delightful beyond all description.
I should do it wrong, if I were to attempt to describe
it. Its beauties are summed up in the lines of my
favourite Italian poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Culte pianure e delicati colli,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chiare acqe, ombrose ripe, e prati molli.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">These lines seem to have been written for Hagley;
but, besides these soft beauties, it has magnificent
prospects of distant mountains, and hills shaded with
wood. The house is magnificent and elegant; we
had several agreeable entertainments of musick in different
parts of the Park, and adapted to the scenes.
In some places, the French horns reverberated from
hill to hill. In the shady parts near the cascades, the
soft musick was concealed and seemed to come from
the unseen genius of the wood. We were all in
great spirits, and enjoyed the amusements prepared
for us. Mr. Montagu grew better every day, by the air
and exercise, and returned to London quite well,
though he had been much pulled down by the fashionable
cold called l’influenza.</p>

<p>“... He carried me to see Oxford, which, indeed,
I had been at before; but when there are so many
cities built for trade and commerce, it is always so
pleasant to me to see there are places dedicated to
the improvement of the human mind and the nobler
commerce with the Muses; and tho’ it is easy to find
fault in everything, yet I think these places of education
and study must have been of great service in
advancing the noblest interests of mankind, the improvement
of knowledge, and harmonizing the mind.</p>

<p>“We went to Blenheim, which I saw with great
pleasure, as the monument of England’s foreign glory
and national gratitude. In our return to town, we
saw Warwick Castle, the seat of the great Neville,
surnamed ‘the Make-King.’ We visited his tomb
and the monuments of Beauchamps, Nevilles, and
Brookes. I walked an hour under some trees, on a
beautiful terrass where Lord Brooke and Sir Philip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Sydney used to take their morning’s walk, blending,
I dare say, as in his ‘Arcadia,’ Wisedom of state
and schemes of great enterprize with rural talk.</p>

<p>“In our next stage, we saw Kenilworth Castle,
once the strong place of Simon de Montfort, since
the seat of the Earl of Leicester. He entertained
Queen Elizabeth there in all the pageantry of the old
times of chivalry. From the lake a lady came, who
told the queen, in rude rhime, that she had been
confined there ever since the days of Merlin, but her
majesty’s power had set her free. The lake is now
dry’d up. The place no longer belongs to ambition
or luxury. Laughing Ceres re-assumed the land, and
what the proud rebel and the assuming favorite left
is enjoy’d by a farmer. There are great remains of
the stately castle, made more venerable by the finest
ivy I ever saw. I could wish this object placed rather
at the edge of a bleak mountain, and that it frowned
on a desert, but it unhappily overlooks a sweet pastoral
scene; however, the memory of the illustrious
persons it has belonged to gives the mind that serious
solemn, disposition its situation wants.</p>

<p>“But you who walk on classic ground will despise
my Gothick antiquities. I will own my Nevilles and
Montforts dare not stand equal with your Gracchi,
nor my Earl of Leicester with any of the favorites
of Augustus; but, perhaps, to the rough virtues and
untamed valour of these potent rebels, we owe part
of our present liberty and happiness, and even our
taste for the venerable remains of ancient Rome....
I desire my most affectionate love to my brother;
and to my nephew and godson, my best wishes; and
I desire he will be a Roman, not an Italian. I beg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
to go back as far as before the ruin of Carthage
for his morals.” ...</p>

<p>In a fragment of a letter written in 1763, Mrs.
Montagu says:</p>

<p>“Miss Hunter has come back in the character of
the Fair Penitent. Her lover was soon tired of an
engagement which had not the sanctions of virtue
and honour. Shame and a fatherless babe she has
brought back. I hope her miserable fate will deter
adventurous damsels from such experiments.” Kitty
Hunter’s fate was far from being miserable. She
married Captain Clarke, who became Field Marshal
Sir Alured Clarke; and the once audacious maid of
honour died in the odour of fashion, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1810.</p>

<p>In 1764, Mrs. Montagu was an invalid—one who
would fulfil the duties of her position, but who was
glad to withdraw from them to the repose of Sandleford.
Supremely admired as she was in society for
the brilliancy of her talents, Mrs. Montagu was seen
to the greatest advantage when at home with one or
a very few choice friends. After Mrs. Elizabeth
Carter had spent some time with her at pleasant
Sandleford, she wrote to Mrs. Vesey. “... For
most part of the time we were entirely alone....
Our friend, you know, has talents which must distinguish
her in the largest circles; but there it is
impossible for one fully to discover either the beauties
of her character or the extent and variety of her
understanding, which always improves on a more accurate
examination and on a nearer view.... The
charm is inexpressibly heightened when it is complicated
with the affections of the heart.” Mr. Pennington,
Mrs. Carter’s nephew, and editor of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
correspondence, states that those who did not know
Mrs. Montagu in her exclusive home character were
ignorant of the real charms of her understanding,
the strength of her mind, and the goodness of her
heart.</p>

<p>One of her great trials visited her this year—the
death of her constant and venerated friend, the Earl
of Bath. There is no letter in the unpublished collection
which bears any reference to Lord Bath’s
death—Walpole’s great enemy, and Mrs. Montagu’s
most devoted and admiring friend. It would be difficult
to say whether this accomplished nobleman, or
the good Lord Lyttelton, or the profound Lord
Kames, or discerning Burke had the greatest veneration
for the mental endowments of Mrs. Montagu.
It may be here added, as a sample of one or two
other ladies of the last century, that after Lord Bath
was a widower, and had been made childless by the
loss of his gallant son, unattached ladies made offers
of marriage to him, he being one of the wealthiest
men of the day. They proposed seriously, like Mrs.
Anne Pitt, or by strong innuendo, like Lady Bell
Finch. The latter, on Lord Bath returning to her
half a crown which he had borrowed, wished he could
give her a crown. Lady Bell replied, that though he
could not give her a crown, he could give her a coronet,
and that she was ready to accept it! Lyttelton
celebrated the friendship which existed between Mrs.
Montagu, Lord Bath, and himself in 1762, in a little
poem called “The Vision.” The noble poet told
how a bard appeared to him, and how the minstrel
sang of the superiority of the myrtle to the oak,
then—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... closed the bard his mystic song,—his shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrunk from my grasp and into air decay’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But left imprinted on my ravish’d view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The forms of Pult’ney and of Montagu.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the earl’s death, his will was as much the
subject of conversation as his decease. Chesterfield
calculated that, in money and land, he left to the
value of £2,400,000, and made his sole legatee the
brother, General Pulteney, whom he never loved.
“The legacies he has left are trifling; for, in truth,
he cared for nobody. The words give and bequeath
were too shocking for him to repeat, and so he left
all in one word, to his brother.” In 1767 General
Pulteney died.</p>

<p>The next letter is dated from Mrs. Montagu’s
Northumberland residence, Denton Castle (or Hall),
December 7, 1766. It is addressed to Mrs. Robinson,
and contains long and premature congratulations
on the expected birth of her sister-in-law’s next
baby, and then continues: “I am still in the
northern regions, but I hope in a fortnight to return
to London. We have had a mild season, and this
house is remarkably warm, so that I have not suffered
from cold. Business has taken up much of my
time, and as we had farms to let against next May-day,
and I was willing to see the new colliery begin
to trade to London before I left the country, I had
the prudence to get the better of my taste for
society. I had this day the pleasure of a letter from
Billingsgate (a polite part of the world for a lady to
correspond with) that the first ships which were then
arrived were much approved. At Lynne they have
also succeeded, and these are the two great coal-markets.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
So now, as soon as I can get all the ends
and bottoms of our business wound up, I shall set
out for Hill Street.</p>

<p>“I spent a month in Scotland this summer, and
made a further progress than Mr. Gray did. An old
friend of Mr. Montagu’s and mine came to us here,
and brought his daughter the end of July, and summoned
me to keep a promise I had made him, of
letting him be my knight-errant and escort me round
Scotland.</p>

<p>“The 1st of August we set forward. I called on
the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland at Alnwick
Castle, in my way. It is the most noble Gothick
building imaginable. Its antique form is preserved
on the outside. Within the apartments are also
Gothick in their structure and ornaments, but convenient
and noble; so that modern elegance arranges
and conducts antique strength and grandeur, leaves
its sublimity of character, but softens what was rude
and unpolished.</p>

<p>“My next day’s journey carried me to Edinburgh,
where I staid about ten days. I passed my time
there very agreeably, receiving every polite attention
from all the people of distinction in the town. I
never saw anything equal to the hospitality of the
Scotch. Every one seemed to make it their business
to attend me to all the fine places in the neighbourhood,
to invite me to dinner, to supper, etc. As
I had declined an invitation to go to Glasgow, the
Lord Provost of Glasgow insisted on my coming to
his villa near the town, instead of going to a noisy
inn. I staid three days there to see the seats in the
environs, and the great cathedral, and the college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and academy for painting, and then I set out for
Inverary. I should first tell you, Glasgow is the
most beautiful town in Great Brittain. The houses,
according to the Scotch fashion, are large and high,
and built of freestone; the streets very broad, and
built at right angles. All dirty kinds of business are
carried on in separate districts, so that nothing appears
but a noble and elegant simplicity.</p>

<p>“My road from Glasgow to Inverary lay by the
side of the famous lake called Loughlomon. Never
did I see the sublime and beautiful so united. The
lake is in some places eight miles broad, in others
less; adorned with many islands, of which some rise
in a conical figure, and are covered with fir-trees up
to the summit. Other islands are flatter. Deer are
feeding in their green meadows. In the lontananza
rise the mountains, on whose barren breast</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The labouring clouds do seem to rest.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The lake is bright as crystal, and the shore consists
of alabaster pebbles. Thus I travelled near twenty
miles, till I came to the village of Leess, where I lay
at an inn, there being no gentleman’s house near it.
The next morning I began to ascend the Highland
mountains. I got out of the chaise to climb to the
top of one, to take my leave of the beautiful lake.
The sun had not been long up; its beams danced on
the lake, and we saw this lovely water meandering
for twenty-five miles. Immediately after I returned
to my chaise, I began to be inclosed in a deep valley
between vast mountains, down whose furrowed cheeks
torrents rushed impetuously, and united in a river in
a vale below. Winter’s rains had so washed away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the soil from some of the steep mountains, there
appeared little but the rock which, like the skeleton
of a giant, appeared more terrible than the perfect
form. Other mountains were covered with a dark
brown moss. The shaggy goats were browsing on
their sides. Here and there appeared a storm-struck
tree or blasted shrub, from whence no lark ever
saluted the morn with joyous hymn, or Philomel
sooth’d the dull ear of night; but from thence the
eagle gave the first lessons of flight to her young,
and taught them to make war on the kids.</p>

<p>“In the Vale of Glencoe, we stopp’d to dine
amidst the rude magnificence of nature rather than
in the meanest of the works of art, so did not enter
the cottage which called itself an inn. From thence,
my servant brought me fresh herrings and bread;
and my Lord Provost’s wife had fill’d my maid’s
chaise with good things; so very luxuriously we
feasted. I wish’d Ossian would have come to us,
and told a tale of other times. However, imagination
and memory assisted, and we recollected many
passages in the very places that inspired them. I
staid three hours listening to the roaring stream, and
hoped some ghost would come on the blast of the
mountain and show us the three grey stones erected
to his memory. After dinner, we went on about
fourteen miles, still in the valley; mountain rising
above mountain till we ascended to Inverary. There
we at once entered the vale where lies the vast lake
called Lough Fine, of whose dignity I cannot give
you a better notion than by telling you the great
leviathan had taken his pastime therein the night
before I was there. Tho’ it is forty miles from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the sea, whales come up there often in the herring
season....</p>

<p>“At Inverary, I was lodged at a gentleman’s
house, invited to another’s in the neighbourhood, and
attended round the Duke of Argylle’s policy (such is
called the grounds dedicated to beauty and ornament).
I went also to see the castle built by the late duke.
It appears small by the vast objects near it. This
great lake before—a vast mountain covered with
firr and beech behind—it, so that, relatively, the
castle is little. I was obliged to return back to
Glasgow the same way, not having time to make the
tour of the Highlands. Lord Provost had an excellent
dinner and good company ready for us. The
next day I went to Lord Kames’, near Sterling,
where I had promised to stay a day. I pass’d a day
very agreeably there, but could not comply with their
obliging entreaties to stay a longer time, but was
obliged to return to Edinburgh. Lord Kames attended
me to Stirling Castle, which is on the road,
and from thence to the iron-works at Carron. Then
again I was on classical ground. We dined at Mr.
Dundass’s. At night, I got back to Edinburgh,
where I rested myself three days, and then, on my
road, lay at Dr. Gilbert Elliot’s, and spent a day with
him and Lady Elliot. They facilitated my journey
by lending me relays, which the route did not always
furnish; so I sent my own horses a stage forward.
I crossed the Tweed again; dined and lay at the
Bishop of Carlisle’s, at Rose Castle, and then came
home much pleased with the expedition, and grateful
for the infinite civilities I had received.</p>

<p>“My evenings at Edinburgh passed very agreeably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
with Doctor Robertson, Doctor Blair, Lord Kames,
and divers ingenious and agreeable persons. My
friend, Doctor Gregory, who was my fellow traveller,
tho’ he is a mathematician, has a fine imagination, an
elegant taste, and every quality to make an agreeable
companion.... He came back to Denton with me,
but soon left us. I detain’d his two daughters, who
are still with us; they are most amiable children....</p>

<p>“I was told Mr. Gray was rather reserved when he
was in Scotland, tho’ they were disposed to pay
him great respect. I agree perfectly with him, that
to endeavour to shine in conversation and to lay
out for admiration is very paltry. The wit of the
company, next to the butt of the company, is the
meanest person in it. But at the same time, when a
man of celebrated talents disdains to mix in common
conversation, or refuses to talk on ordinary subjects,
it betrays a latent pride. There is a much brighter
character than that of a wit or a poet, or a savant,
which is that of a rational and sociable being, willing to
carry on the commerce of life with all the sweetness
and condescension decency and virtue will permit.
The great duty of conversation is to follow suit, as
you do at whist. If the eldest hand plays the deuce
of diamonds, let not his next neighbour dash down
the king of hearts, because his hand is full of
honours. I do not love to see a man of wit win all
the tricks in conversation, nor yet to see him sullenly
pass. I speak not this of Mr. Gray in particular;
but it is the common failing of men of genius to
assert a proud superiority or maintain a prouder indolence.
I shall be very glad to see Mr. Gray whenever
he will be pleased to do me the favour. I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
he is the first poet of the age; but if he comes to my
fireside, I will teach him not only to speak prose, but
to talk nonsense, if occasion be.... I would not
have a poet always sit on the proud summit of the
forked hill. I have a great respect for Mr. Gray as
well as a high admiration.” ...</p>

<p>Whenever Mrs. Montagu got up to ride a simile,
there was ground for anxiety on the part of her
friends; some among them, too, must have wished
that she had called a nightingale a nightingale, and
not “philomel.” In travel, however, she saw what
she saw, which many travellers never do. She was
not at all like the wife of Sir George Cornewall mentioned
by Lady Malmesbury, in a letter to her son,
written at Chambéry, 1816: “She never looks at
anything, but works in the carriage all day long. She
will not even go to Chamouni;” or that other lady
who, passing through the sublimest of mountain
scenery, kept her eyes shut, declaring that it was too
beautiful to look at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

</div>

<p>In 1769, the critical state of public affairs drew
from Mrs. Montagu the following reflection: “I hope
I shall see all my friends safe and well at my return
to town; but, indeed, a wicked mob and a foolish
ministry may produce strange events. It was better
in old times, when the ministry was wicked and the
mob foolish.... Ministers, however wicked, do not
pull down houses, nor ignorant mobs pull down government.
A mob that can read and a ministry that
cannot think are sadly matched.”</p>

<p>In truth, however, Mrs. Montagu was engaged during
this year on a work which was not only praiseworthy
for the motive which induced her to undertake
it, but honourable to her for its execution, and it may
almost be added, glorious to her personally in its
results.</p>

<p>In 1769 Mrs. Montagu published, anonymously,
her “Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare.”
This work, once widely famous, may still be
read with pleasure. It was written in reply to Voltaire’s
grossly indecent attack on our national poet.
Some previous allusion which he had made to Shakespeare,
to show his own learning, had directed the
notice of French readers to a new dramatic literature
which soon won their admiration. Voltaire’s jealousy
induced him to denounce what he had before extolled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
and he did this in the spirit of the tiger and the
monkey—the component elements, according to his
own mendacious saying, of all Frenchmen. He had
no deep knowledge of the subject he affected to criticise,
and was not made of the stuff that could lead
him to feel sympathy with the lofty sentiments, or to
be stirred by the searching wit of the greatest of
dramatic poets. Voltaire could no more appreciate
Shakespeare than he could estimate the divine character
of Joan of Arc. If Joan’s own countrymen
betrayed her, Voltaire stands foremost among Frenchmen
as the beastly polluter of her spotless reputation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu makes the following playful allusion
to her authorship, in a letter to Lord Lyttelton,
December, 1769: “I am sorry to tell you that a
friend of yours is no longer a concealed scribbler. I
had better have employed the town crier to proclaim
me an author; but, being whispered, it has circulated
with incredible swiftness. I hear Mr. Andrew
Stone is very indulgent to my performance, which
much flatters my vanity. Mr. Melmoth, at Bath,
flatters me; but I am most flattered that a brother
writer says the book would be very well if it had not
too much wit. I thought there had been no wit at
all in it; and I am as much pleased as M. Jourdain
was when his preceptor told him he spoke prose. If
my wit hurts anybody or anything, it is chance-medley—no
premeditated malice; neither art nor
part has my will therein. I don’t love wit: it is a
poor, paltry thing, and fit only for a Merry Andrew.</p>

<p>“I look very innocent when I am attacked about
the essay, and say, ‘I don’t know what you mean!’
I shall set about a new edition as soon as your lordship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
comes to town; for the first thousand is in great
part sold, tho’ the booksellers have done me all the
prejudice in their power.” The new edition was even
more successful than the first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s defence may appear a little too
apologetic now; but it is marked by good taste, by
evidences of deep thought, by flashes of wit, and by
the grasp she has, firmly and gracefully, on her subject.
She deals with dramatic poetry and the historical
drama, examines the first and second parts of
“Henry IV.,” treats of the preternatural beings of
Shakespeare, and ends by a comparison of “Cinna”
and “Julius Cæsar.” If any may differ with her in
respect to Corneille, whose third act of “Cinna” is
worthy of the great French dramatic poet, no reader
will hesitate to praise the earnestness and delicacy
with which this Lady of the Last Century has executed
her noble task.</p>

<p>A French translation appeared in Paris in 1777—the
year before Voltaire died. In England, six editions
of the essay were published, the last in 1810.
In 1827, it had the honour of being noticed with high
praise, by M. Villemain, in his “Nouveaux Mélanges
Historiques et Littéraires;” and in 1840, an edition
in Italian was published in Florence.</p>

<p>Few English readers had read Voltaire so thoughtfully
as Mrs. Montagu, and perhaps none reflected
more on what they read than she did, or gave more
graceful expression to consequent judgment. One
side of Voltaire’s character she described (while the
witty Frenchman was preparing his attack on Shakespeare)
to Lord Kames.</p>

<p>“Voltaire sent a tragedy to Paris, which he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
was composed in ten days. The players sent it back
to him to correct. At threescore and ten one should
not think his wit would outrun his judgment; but he
seems to begin a second infancy in wit and philosophy,—a
dangerous thing to one who has such an
antipathy to leading-strings.” It was Voltaire’s self-praise
that offended Mrs. Montagu as much as his
offensive condescension to, and disparagement of,
Shakespeare. When she was told that Voltaire had
said boastingly: “C’est moi qui autrefois parlai le
premier de ce Shakespeare. C’est moi qui le premier
montrai aux Français quelques perles que j’avais
trouvé dans son fumier.” “Ah!” replied Mrs. Montagu,
with great readiness, “C’est un fumier qui a
fertilisé une terre bien ingrate.” French fashionable
circles, which loved wit and cared not a jot who suffered
by it, received and repeated the saying of the
accomplished English lady as if it had been ten times
more brilliant than it was in reality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s defence of Shakespeare was not
too tenderly treated by her own friends. All the
frankness of friendship was cheerfully given to it.
The plain-spoken Dowager Countess Gower thus
wrote soon after the appearance of the Vindication:</p>

<p><i>1769.</i>—“Fortune has blest this forest with the
geniuses of the age; Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Carter,
Mrs. Dunbar, etc., etc., and Lord Lyttelton are at
Sunning Wells, and sport sentiment from morn till
noon, from noon till dewy eve. I molest ’em not;
contenting myself in my rustic simplicity. ’Tis a stupidity
that may be felt, I don’t doubt, but not by me.
Mrs. Montagu has commenced author, in vindication
of Shakespeare, who wants none; therefore her performance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
must be deemed a work of supererogation.
Some commend it. I’ll have it, because I can throw
it aside when I’m tired.” Johnson treated it with
greater brutality. He had once compared Mrs. Montagu
with Queen Elizabeth, and had recognized in the
former the greater qualifications. Now, he denounced
the essay when he had only looked into it. He had
taken up an end of the web, and finding packthread,
thought it useless, as he said, to go further in search
of embroidery. Reynolds thought it did her honour,
which Johnson allowed, but he spoiled the admission
by asserting that it would do honour to no one else.
Garrick said she had pointed out Voltaire’s blunders;
to which Johnson replied, that it wasn’t worth while,
and that there was no merit in the way of doing it.
Subsequently, he declared: “Neither I, nor Beauclerk,
nor Mrs. Thrale could get through the book!”—a
declaration which was unfounded, as far as Mrs.
Thrale was concerned; for she protested that she had
read it with pleasure. The great man, in short, talked
nonsense, but dressed it in fine words. “There was
no real criticism in it,” he said, “showing the beauty
of thought, as formed in the workings of the human
heart.” Mrs. Montagu did not feel called on to
exhibit any such beauty or any such superstructure.
She exposed the blundering arrogance of Voltaire,
who first praised Shakespeare, for the annoyance of
his own countrymen, and then, finding the French inclined
to accept the praise, aspersed brutally the poet
whom he had pillaged without mercy.</p>

<p>Johnson thought little of Garrick, probably because
Garrick approved the object of Mrs. Montagu’s
Shakespearian essay, and because the lady gave very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
high praise to Garrick as an actor. Johnson thought
it was fit that she should say much, and that he
should say nothing, in Garrick’s praise. Accomplished
Bruin, however, said much to the great player’s
disparagement. He maintained that Garrick had
been overpaid for what he had done for Shakespeare.
“Sir, he has not made Shakespeare better known.
He cannot illustrate Shakespeare!” When Johnson
afterward wrote to Mrs. Thrale, that speaking of
“Shakespeare and Nature” rightly brought Mrs.
Montagu into his mind, he is supposed to be inconsistent,
when he was, it may be, only satirical. He certainly
uttered a judgment on the essay, which is not
to be gainsaid, when he maintained, according to Mr.
Seward, that the work was “ad hominem, conclusive
against Voltaire,” and that “she had done, sir, what
she intended to do.”</p>

<p>The greatest praise which the essay received was
awarded to it by Cowper many years after it was published.
Writing on May 27, 1788, to Lady Hesketh,
Cowper said: “I no longer wonder that Mrs. Montagu
stands at the head of all that is called learned,
and that every critic veils his bonnet to her superior
judgment. I am now reading and have reached the
middle of her essay on the genius of Shakespeare—a
book of which, strange as it may seem, though I
must have read it formerly, I had absolutely forgot
the existence.</p>

<p>“The learning, the good sense, the sound judgment,
and the wit displayed in it fully justify, not
only my compliment, but all compliments that either
have been already paid to her talents, or shall be paid
hereafter. Voltaire, I doubt not, rejoiced that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
antagonist wrote in English, and that his countrymen
could not possibly be judges of the dispute. Could
they have known how much she was in the right, and
by how many thousand miles the Bard of Avon is superior
to all their dramatists, the French critic would
have lost half his fame among them.”</p>

<p>While honour was being showered on the writer
of the essay, ill health, from which she suffered long
and frequently, marred her triumph.</p>

<p>Writing to Mrs. W. Robinson, from Hill Street,
November the 19th, 1770, she says: “... I fell ill
on my journey to Denton, or rather, indeed, began the
journey indisposed, and only aggravated my complaints
by travelling. Sickness and bad weather deprived
me of the pleasure of seeing the beauties of Derbyshire.
However, I got a sight of the stately Palace
of Lord Scarsdale, where the arts of antient Greece
and the delicate pomp of modern ages unite to make
a most magnificent habitation. It is the best worth
seeing of any house, I suppose, in England. But I
know how it is that one receives but moderate pleasure
in the works of art. There is a littleness in
every work of man. The operations of nature are
vast and noble, and I found much greater pleasure
in the contemplation of Lord Breadalbane’s mountains,
rocks, and lakes than in all the efforts of human
art at Lord Scarsdale’s.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s illness increasing at Denton, she
writes: “Doctor Gregory came from Edinburgh to
make me a visit, and persuaded me to go back with
him. The scheme promised much pleasure, and, I
flattered myself, might be conducive to health, as the
doctor, of whose medical skill I have the highest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
opinion, would have time to observe and consider my
various complaints. I was glad also to have an opportunity
of amusing my friend, Mrs. Chapone, whom
I carried into the north with me. We had a pleasant
journey to Edinburgh, where we were most agreeably
entertained in Doctor Gregory’s house, all the literate
and polite company of Edinburgh paying me all kind
of attentions; and, by the doctor’s regimen, my health
improved greatly; so that I was prevailed upon to
enjoy my love of prospects by another trip to the
Highlands, my good friend and physician still attending
me. The first day’s journey was to Lord Buchan,
brother to Mr. Charles Erskine, who was the intimate
companion and friendly competitor of my poor brother
Tom. Each of them was qualified for the highest
honours of their profession, which they would have
certainly attained, had it pleased God to have granted
longer life. Lord Buchan had received great civilities
at Horton when he was pursuing his law studies
in England; so he came to visit me as soon as I got
to Edinburgh, and, in the most friendly manner,
pressed my passing some days at his house in Perthshire.
I got there by an easy day’s journey, having
also walked a long time about the castle of Stirling,
which commands a very beautiful prospect.</p>

<p>“Lord Buchan’s place is very fine and in a very
singular style. His house looks to the south, over
a very rich valley, rendered more fertile as well as
more beautiful by the meanderings of the river Forth.
Behind his house rise great hills covered with wood,
and over them stupendous rocks. The goats look
down with an air of philosophic pride and gravity on
folks in the valley. One in particular seemed to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
capable of addressing the famous beast of Gavaudan,
if he had been there, with as much disdain as Diogenes
did the great conqueror of the East. Here I
passed two days very agreeably, and then his lordship
and my doctor attended me to my old friend
Lord Kinnoul’s. You may imagine my visit there
gave me a great deal of pleasure besides what arose
from seeing a fine place. I was delighted to find an
old friend enjoying that heartfelt happiness which attends
a life of virtue. Lord Kinnoul is continually
employed in encouraging agriculture and manufactures,
protecting the weak from injury, assisting the
distressed, and animating the young people to whatever
in their various stations is most fit and proper....
He appears more happy in this situation than
when he was whirled about in the vortex of the Duke
of Newcastle. The situation of a Scottish nobleman
of fortune is enough to fill the ambition of a reasonable
man, for they have power to do a great deal of good.</p>

<p>“From Dupplin we went to Lord Breadalbane’s,
at Taymouth. Here unite the sublime and beautiful.
The house is situated in a valley where the verdure
is the finest imaginable; noble beeches adorn it, and
beautiful cascades fall down the midst of it. Through
this valley you are led to a vast lake. On one side
of the lake there is a fine country; on the other,
mountains lift their heads or hide them in the clouds.
In some places ranges of rocks look like vast fortifyed
cittadels. I passed two days in this fine place, where
I was entertained with the greatest politeness and
kindest attentions, Lord Breadalbane seeming to take
the greatest pleasure in making everything easy,
agreeable, and convenient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“My next excursion was to Lord Kames’; and
then I returned to Edinburgh. With Lord Kames
and his lady I have had a correspondence ever since
I was first in Scotland, so I was there received with
cordial friendship. I must do the justice to the
Scottish nation to say, they are the most politely
hospitable of any people in the world. I had innumerable
invitations of which I could not avail
myself, having made as long a holiday from my business
in Northumberland as I could afford.</p>

<p>“The newspapers will inform you of the death of
Mr. George Grenville. I think he is a great loss to
the publick; and tho’ in these days of ribbaldry and
abuse he was often much calumniated, I believe time
will vindicate his character as a publick man: as a
private one, he was quite unblemished. I regret the
loss to myself. I was always pleased and informed
by his conversation. He had read a vast deal, and
had an amazing memory. He had been versed in
business from his youth; so that he had a very rich
fund of conversation, and he was good-natured and
very friendly.</p>

<p>“The King’s Speech has a warlike tone. But still
we flatter ourselves that the French king’s aversion
to war may prevent our being again engaged in
one.... Lord Chatham was to have spoken in the
House of Lords to-day, if poor Mr. Grenville’s death,
which happened at seven this morning, had not hindered
his appearing in publick....</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu did not leave Denton till almost a
week after I came away; and he was stop’d at Durham
by waters being out; but I had the pleasure of
hearing yesterday that he got safe to Darlington, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
he was to pass a few days with a famous mathematician,
but I expect him in town the end of this week.
My nephew, Morris, has got great credit at Eton already....
My doctors order me to forbear writing,
but this letter does not show my obedience to them....
The celebrated coterie will go on, in spite of
all remonstrances, and there is to be an assembly
thrice a week for the subscribers to the opera, so
little impression do rumours of wars and apprehensions
of the plague make in the fine world....</p>

<p>“I am in your debt for my pretty neice’s dancing-master,
which I forgot when I had the pleasure of
seeing you. I shall hope to supply her, as opportunity
offers, with all the assistance of that sort
which her happy genius will make of great use to
her; but your constant care will supply many better
things than those the artists teach, and I do not
doubt of her making an amiable and valuable woman.
With the most sincere regard, I am, dear madam,
your very affectionate sister, and faithful friend, and
humble servt., E. M.... I know you will be very
glad to hear I left everything in such order in the
north, that I shall not pay my devotions to ye pole-star
again for some years.”</p>

<p>No two people had more delight in mutual conversation
than Mrs. Montagu and Lord Kames.
They were so agreed upon one subject,—the insincerity,
ignorance, and meanness of Voltaire, as to
make their conversation most lively when it turned
upon the Frenchman who defiled the character of the
most glorious of Frenchwomen, Joan of Arc,—who
heaped abuse upon Shakespeare and on those who
defended him,—and who hated and miscalled Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Kames for having weighed his “Henriade” in the
scales of criticism, and for having found it “wanting.”
Over this reply of Voltaire to Lord Kames,
that judge and philosopher, reading it aloud, laughed
himself, and raised irrepressible laughter in the lady
who listened to him. The reply is in one of Voltaire’s
“Lettres à un Journaliste.” “Permit me to explain
to you some whimsical singularities of ‘The Elements
of Criticism,’ in three volumes, by Lord
Makames (sic), a justice of peace in Scotland. That
philosopher has a most profound knowledge of nature
and art, and he uses the utmost efforts to make the
rest of the world as wise as himself. He begins by
proving that we have five senses; and that we are
less struck by a gentle impression made on our eyes
and ears, by colours and sounds, than by a knock on
the head or a kick on the leg. Proceeding from that
to the rules of time and space, M. Home concludes
with mathematical precision, that time seems long to
a lady who is about to be married, and short to a man
who is going to be hanged. M. Home applies doctrines
equally extraordinary to every department of
art. It is a surprising effect of the progress of the
human mind, that we should now receive from Scotland
rules for our taste in all matters, from an epic
poem down to a garden. Knowledge extends daily,
and we must not despair of hereafter obtaining performances
in poetry and oratory from the Orkney
Islands. M. Home always lays down his opinions as
a law, and extends his despotic sway far and wide.
He is a judge who absorbs all appeals.”</p>

<p>The famous mathematician to whom Mrs. Montagu
refers in the above letter was William Emerson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of whom Mr. Montagu is believed to have been the
original patron. Mr. Montagu may, in some degree,
have helped that poor and eccentric scholar, but the
energies of the once idle Yorkshire dreamer were
really developed by an injustice. He had married
the niece of a clergyman, who basely cheated the
bride out of her dowry of £500. Whereupon the
proud and angry husband sent back the whole of his
wife’s wardrobe, with the message that he would
“scorn to be beholden to such a fellow for a rag!”
When Mr. Montagu married Elizabeth Robinson,
Emerson had just ready for the press the work
which gave him a place in the highest rank of
mathematicians—his “Doctrine of Fluxions.” The
distinction neither affected his eccentricity nor softened
his audacity. He was wont to sign his mathematical
solutions with a name that might have made
Minerva breathless—“Philofluentimechanelgegeomastrolonzo,”
and he lived to shock Mrs. Edward
Montagu by snapping his fingers at the Royal Society,
and damning the fellows and their fellowships!</p>

<p>George Grenville and Burke are among the best
samples of the men whom Mrs. Montagu appreciated,
and who could thoroughly appreciate Mrs.
Montagu. Burke has spoken in the highest terms
of both. Of the statesman who, five years before
his death, resigned all his offices, Burke said: “With
a masculine understanding and a stout and resolute
heart, he had an application undissipated and unwearied.
He took public business, not as a duty he
was to fulfil, but as a pleasure he was to enjoy; and
he seemed to have no delight out of the house, except
in such things as in some way related to the business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
that was to be done within it. If he was ambitious, I
will say this for him, that his ambition was of a noble
and generous strain. It was to raise himself not by
the low, pimping politics of a court, but to win his
way to power through the laborious gradations of
public service, and to secure himself a well-earned
rank in Parliament, by a thorough knowledge of its
constitution and in perfect practice in all its business.”
Mrs. Montagu might justly be proud of the
good opinion of a friend who could express such a
judgment of another friend like Grenville, for whom
she herself entertained the highest esteem.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu to Mrs. Robinson. “<i>January 17,
1771.</i> ... I have kept very well all this frost, and
what is more strange in a town lady, I have been
very discreet. I have improved upon Lady Grace’s
plan of doing very soberly. I have been serious,
and solemn and retired, and have sat as quietly at my
fireside as any antiquated dowager when her quadrille
party was gone into the country. But I have said
enough upon such an atom, and I will now talk of
ye great persons and things of this world. The
Duke of Bedford died of a fit of the asthma. He
departed singing the 104th Psalm. This shows he
had some piety, but I think his grace sang out of
tune; so I am not an admirer of his singing.” (Walpole
says he “had lost his sight, and almost his
speech and limbs.”) “I like a Psalm-singing cobler
in death as well as in life. A poor man who has
maintained a wife and children by his labour, has
kept the ten commandments, has observed the Sabbath,
kept the laws of the community, and lived
kindly with his neighbours, may sing his own requiem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
with a comfortable and cheerful assurance.
Of him to whom little is given, little shall be required.
But the debtor and creditor of a long
account is not so easily settled. Wealth, titles,
power give a great influence in society. Have the
poor been relieved, the weak protected, the industrious
been encouraged, virtue countenanced, merit
brought forth to view, the profligate discouraged, the
commonwealth served equal to its great demands on
a Duke of Bedford, the proprietor of a vast estate?
I mean not to intimate that he was to dye in despair,
for his Judge is merciful, but in his sight no man
living shall be justified; so that, unless there is an
uncommon merit or innocence of character, I see no
reason for this kind of jollity. His grace has left
enough to make the duchess’s jointure £6,000 a year.
She is to keep up the houses at Bloomsbury and at
Wooburn. Her grace, Mr. Palmer, and the Duchess
of Marlborough are trustees for the young duke....</p>

<p>“As the late duke was sometimes headstrong, the
court will have an advantage in having the duchess
to deal with, as Lord Sandwich is her guide in politicks.
The duke left Mr. Rigby £5,000, a sum for
which he had Mr. Rigby’s bond. He has left a sum
of fourscore pound a year to Miss Wrottesley; a
year’s wages to servants. I hear not of other legacies.
It is believed Lord Suffolk will not accept of
any place....</p>

<p>“It is believed we shall have a Peace. The King
of Prussia and the Emperor joined to get a peace for
the Turks. These potentates design to keep the
French in order and to defend Germany. The Emperor
wishes to recover Lorraine and Alsace. So it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
is supposed the French will sit quiet even if the
Spaniards should go to war with us. I am not afraid
of the Dons, if not assisted by French vivacity. All
our family is well, and the <i>père de famille</i> best of all....
Mr. M. is pure well.”</p>

<p>The following letter to Mrs. Robinson, the writer’s
sister-in-law, whose father, Mr. Richardson, was a
private gentleman of Kensington, contains a reference
to the Kensington “ladies’-school” of the writer’s
early time, and one to the Chelsea school, where she
visited Mrs. William Robinson’s daughter in 1772.
These references are valuable illustrations of the
female scholastic life of the two periods. “I called
on my pretty neice at Chelsea, who I had the pleasure
of finding in perfect health, with a little addition
of embonpoint extremely becoming. She received
me very politely, and her governesses spoke much in
her praise. Indeed, she is a very good subject for
them, appearing to have much good-humour, docility,
and everything I could wish.” The young Sarah
Elizabeth’s extremely becoming embonpoint induced
her sagacious aunt to look at her stays. “I found
fault with her stays,” she writes, “which lift up her
shoulders; and they say they had your leave to get
others, but I could not understand why they had
neglected to do it. I was pleased to find my neice
perfectly clean and neat, tho’ I called on ye Saturday,
which is usually only the eve of cleanliness. I remember
at Mrs. Robartes’, at Kensington, the girls
used to be so dirty, sometimes one could not salute
them!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

</div>

<p>Mrs. William Robinson, who, with her husband
and children, had been so long abroad, had now
returned to England, and had visited Mr. and Mrs.
Montagu. Late in the year, Mrs. Montagu wrote to
her sister-in-law:</p>

<p>“<i>August ye 9th, 1772.</i> ... I am quite ashamed
to think how ungrateful I must have appeared to you
and my brother for your kind visit and obliging letter,
in letting so long a time pass before I returned my
thanks. Your visit appeared to us like a pleasant
dream, from which we were sorry to awake and find
ourselves deserted by such agreable guests. The
Duchess of Portland arrived in two or three days
after your departure. She made me rather a longer
visit than you did, but still a much shorter than I
wished it. Her grace submitted with infinite good-humour
to all the awkwardnesses of a Tunbridge
lodging. We had, happily, that kind of weather
which makes pastoral life agreable. I was delighted
to find that time had not robbed her grace of her
pleasing vivacity, and we laugh’d as heartily as we
used to do in our younger days. Her grace gave me
as a fairing the most beautiful, rich, and elegant snuff-box
I ever saw, for which I could only return her
thanks; for I thought it would be putting myself too
much upon a par with her, to make a return in kind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
If I could get any natural curiosity to add to her
collection, it would make me very happy.</p>

<p>“Every day after you left us the place began to
fill with company.</p>

<p>“... We have had the finest weather I ever saw
for any long continuance. As a farmer, I have some
fault to find with it. Our wheat, and barley, and turnips
have all suffered by drought. We had not any
reason to complain of our hay, but the grass is very
much burnt. The dearness of all kinds of provisions
have reduced our poor neighbours to a state of
wretchedness which I never saw before in England....
My father has been ill, but I believe his complaints
were nervous, and partly the effects of hot
weather. I wonder how he can endure to live in a
brick oven all the summer season.</p>

<p>“... I went the other day to Winchester, and
dined with Doctor Warton, and saw the school. The
doctor allowed me to ask a play for the boys, which
made them very happy, and gave him leisure to pass
the time with me. My sweet, lovely Miss Gregory
and I set out very early in the morning, so that we
got to Winchester before eleven o’clock, and staid
there till between six and seven, and were at home
in good time.... Miss Gregory and Mrs. Morgan
are much your humble servants.... When you
have an opportunity to get the nankeen, tea, and
handkerchiefs, I can pay what is due for them to
your banker. If a blue tafety, or a white of a very
fine colour should come in your way and seem a
pennyworth, please to add it, or anything you may
have offered that is plain.... Cheap, pretty, plain
muslin for gowns would not come amiss. But, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
smuggling is a dangerous trade, much counterband
goods must not travel in the same box. All possible
love to my dear nephew and neices, with whom I
hope to make a more intimate acquaintance before
they have disposed of all their love and friendship.”</p>

<p><i>August 15, 1772.</i>—Mrs. Montagu to Mrs. Robinson.
“... I was very sorry that your races happened
so untowardly, that I could not edge in my visit without
being complicated in them. I remember the time
when the said races would have a very different effect
than deterring me from the neighbourhood; but we
change to everything and everything changes to us.
I cannot say that as one grows older, one grows so
much wiser as to despise foolish amusements, but one
likes new kinds of follies. I mean we always like
some of those things severe and frowning wisdom
calls follies.</p>

<p>“I had the pleasure in finding Mr. Montagu in
extreme good health, which gave me the higher satisfaction,
as I had been alarmed about him some time
before.</p>

<p>“I went a few miles out of my road to Sandleford,
to fulfill my old promise to Mr. Burke to spend a day
or two with him and Mrs. Burke, at Beaconsfield. I
was sorry that I could not continue there longer than
one whole day, as I was then not so assured that Mr.
Montagu was in perfect health. When the talents of
a man of genius, the acuteness of a politician, the
alert vivacity of a man of business are all employed to
make conversation agreable and society pleasant, one
passes one’s time very delightfully in such company.</p>

<p>“At Beaconsfield, Mr. Burke is an industrious
farmer, a polite husband, a kind master, a charitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
neighbour, and a most excellent companion. The
demons of ambition and party who hover about Westminster
do not extend their influences as far as the
villa. I know not why it is, but these busy spirits
seem more tranquil and pleased in their days of
retreat than the honest, dull justice of the quorum,
who never stretched forth his hand to snatch the
sceptre of power, or raised his voice in publick to fill
the trumpet of fame. A little mind is for ever in a
tracasserie, because it is moved by little things. I
have always found that nothing is so gentle as the
chief out of war, nor so serene and simple as the
statesman out of place. If it were fit to name names
and certify places, I would bring many examples to
justify my assertion. I so much delight in these
working master-spirits in their holiday humour, that
I had rather play at tee-totum or cross and pile with
Julius Cæsar than with Sardanapalus. The first
would have the easy indifference that belongs to play;
the other, the seriousness and anxiety which belong
to business.</p>

<p>“I am now preparing for a little excursion in which
I shall see some of the busy folks of the great world;
so I expect to enjoy my time in the more joyous tranquility.
On Friday, I am to go to Stowe, Lord and
Lady Temple having given me repeated invitations
there. I am much afraid the weather will not favour
my excursion; however, as I shall stay four days at
Stowe, I hope to see those superbe gardens while I
am there in favourable gleams of sunshine. I have
not seen Stowe since I first married. Lord Temple,
I hear, has much improved them.</p>

<p>“I shall have the pleasure of making a visit at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
another fine place which I never yet saw, which is
Lord Nuneham’s, in Oxfordshire.... Mr. Herbert
has given me a very agreable neighbour in Lady
Elizabeth. She has been very well educated, and I
dare say will always behave with great propriety.
Mr. Herbert is a young man of uncommon understanding
and merit. He has come early, and not too
early, into ye possession of an ample fortune.</p>

<p>“... I am much pleased to hear my neice is so
tractable and good; a disposition to oblige her
Parents, and to do what those who love her advise
her to, will make her much happier than wilfulness
and obstinacy.... My nephews, Morris and Matthew,
are just arrived. They are fine boys. Morris grows
very handsome, and he has a very good character
amongst his schoolfellows. These little men will be
a great amusement to Mr. Montagu in my absence. I
passed my time very well at Tunbridge, having so
agreable a companion at home as my sister; so that
I depend on the great world for nothing more than
vagrant amusement at idle hours; and this is all one
can reasonably expect of the great world. One should
have one’s solid comforts at home. One makes a
good meal; the other a pleasant dessert.</p>

<p>“... I regret that poor Mr. Gray is now no more
than Pindar. One fatal moment sets two or three
thousand years aside, and brings the account equal.
I really believe our British Pindar not unequal in
merit to the bard of Thebes. I hope Mr. Gray has
left some works yet unpublished.”</p>

<p>Walpole, who never appears in a more favourable
light than when he speaks with affectionate reverence
of Gray, supplemented Mrs. Montagu’s hopes by saying:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
“I should earnestly wish, if he has destined anything
for the public, to print it at my press. It would
do me honour and give me an opportunity of expressing
what I feel for him. Methinks, as we grow old,
our only business here is to adorn the graves of our
friends or dig our own.”</p>

<p>From these reflections, Mrs. Montagu takes her
readers back to life and its varieties, in a letter without
date, but it is endorsed in a hand, not hers, 1773.</p>

<p>“In the early part of my life I was a most punctual
correspondent; but of late I have been as much
too remiss as I was formerly too diligent in writing
letters. I have at length discovered that writing letters
is idleness without ease, and fatigue without a
purpose. When newspapers only told weddings,
births, and burials, a letter from London bore some
value; but now that the public papers not only tell
when men are born and dye, but every folly they contrive
to insert between those periods, the literary correspondent
has nothing left. Lies and dulness used
to be valued in manuscript, but printing has assumed
a right over the lies of the day and the amusement of
the hour. On stamped paper and by authority are
publish’d what Lady B—— L——e says of a fat
alderman, and how Miss Biddy Bellair was dress’d at
the last masquerade. I can, however, tell you some
news from St. Vincent, which I had just now from
a gentleman in a public office, which is, that an
account has just arrived from Colonel Dalrymple,
with news of the total reduction of the Caribs, in St.
Vincent, and a treaty concluded with them, with small
loss on our side. I could find in my heart to say
‘poor Caribs!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you are not very deeply interested in
Sir George C——ke’s affairs.... I hope no one will
lose anything of such importance as to affect them
essentially, as this disaster has been so long expected.
It was said the other day, his effects amounted to
£700,000, his debts to £300,000; but his contracts
and dealings have been so universal, that I presume
no one can tell ye just sum of the one or the other.
Part of his effects are hemp and alum. Never was so
much of the first used at Tyburn, nor of the second
at the bakers’, as at this moment; but as I presume
those commodities do not bear a settled price, a just
estimate cannot be made. In ye present lack of
specie and of confidence, paper, estates and houses
must sell badly. I hope his unmarried sister will not
lose anything, and that his family will not fall from
affluence to narrow circumstances. I hear Lady
C——ke has an estate in Jamaica of £4,000 per annum
settled upon her. It is said the Irish Bank has
only stopped for awhile, and that nothing will be lost.
The state of that country is very bad. The poor are
wretched, and all people discontented. The condition
of Scotland is not much better. The bankruptcies
there are numerous, and ye manufactories are
stopped. I wish the bankruptcies here may not
have as bad an effect on our trade. I rejoice that my
brother Robinson has returned to his native land,
and wish he would come and visit his friends in town.</p>

<p>“... Mr. Montagu has (in the main) had a pretty
healthful winter. His cough is at present troublesome
to him, but I hope the warm weather we have
now a right to expect will soon cure him.</p>

<p>“The Archbishop of York’s second son, a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
youth dyed of a milliary fever this morning. I lament
the young man, and am heartily concerned for his
family.</p>

<p>“As I have good luck in smuggling, I will wait for
my gown till you come to town, and will send you a
black silk, for which it may serve as a lining. The
taffety will serve for another year, if it be too warm
for this season, when it comes to London.</p>

<p>“I am glad you intend to send my eldest neice to
a boarding-school. What girls learn at these schools
is trifling, but they unlearn what would be of great
disservice—a provincial dialect, which is extreamly
ungenteel, and other tricks that they learn in the
nursery. The carriage of the person, which is of
great importance, is well attended to, and dancing is
well taught. As for the French language I do not
think it necessary, unless for persons in very high
life. It is rarely much cultivated at schools. I believe
all the boarding-schools are much on the same
plan, so that you may place the young lady wherever
there is a good air and a good dancing-master. I
dare say you will find great improvement in her air
and her speech by the time she has been there a year,
and these are points of great importance. The Kentish
dialect is abominable, tho’ not so bad as ye Northumberland
and some others; but in this polish’d age,
it is so unusual to meet with young Ladies who have
any <i>patois</i>, that I mightily wish to see my neice cured
of it.</p>

<p>“The Duke of Gloucester is relapsed into a bad
state of health. Miss Linley, who I suppose you have
seen at Bath, is much in vogue. I am to hear her
sing to-morrow morn at ye Bishop of Bristol’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“... Papa bears Sir G. C——’s shutting shop
very patiently. If his money is safe, he has no objection
to its being locked up. I do not imagine we
shall lose anything. I am only sorry for him and for
his family, as these things must be very unpleasant.
There is a great deal of poverty and distress in London
and in the southern counties. I wish very much
to see my brother Robinson after his long absence.
I rejoice that his health is so good. I wish you could
persuade him to come to London. He improves society,
and it is a pity he should not live in it.”</p>

<p>Another of the writer’s nieces is referred to in the
following discursive letter:</p>

<p>“<i>January ye 1st, 1774.</i> <span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,—I was
very glad to hear that my pretty little friend got safe
to you. I dare say the holidays will pass with her
and her brother and sister in all the gayety and jolly
mirth which belong’d to them in former times. When
our maccaronic beaux and cotterie dames go into the
country to pass the Christmas holydays, I have no
great opinion of the festivity and joy of the party.
Mirth belongs to youth and innocence. When the
World was young and innocent, its laugh was hearty,
and its mirth sincere, and festivals were gay. Old
Father Christmas must now be content to gambol in
the nursery; but such is the force of custom, that
many persons go at this dreary season to their
dreary mansions to keep their Christmas, who will not
laugh till they return to London.</p>

<p>“... I think the fish will come safest by my
neice, as it will escape being rummaged by the custom-house
officers, who will be apt to suspect it has
a pudding of Brussels lace in it. I thank you for two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
pound more of excellent tea. I think it full as good
as that which costs me 16<i>s.</i> a pound.... My pretty
neice is so good-humoured: she is never troublesome.
She is a mighty orderly person, folds up her things
very nicely. She will be both a notable housewife
and a good-humoured woman, and therefore will make
an excellent wife. Happy will be the man to whose
lot she will fall. It is very rarely that one sees these
characters meet. A good housewife is generally an
anxious, peevish thing; and a good-humoured woman
is too often careless and unmindful of her family. As
she is your daughter, I do not wonder at her uniting
perfections that are but rarely united. My brother
William was a favourite of my mother’s, and she certainly
made his whole christening suit of that part of
her linnen which is supposed to derive matrimonial
blessings on the son. For what mother’s darling my
neice is reserved I do not know, but I hope one who
will deserve her.</p>

<p>“I believe you will hardly be able to read my scrawl,
which is even worse than usual; for I have almost
put my eyes out with accounts, of which our steward
brings a plentiful quantity at this time of year. He
is a very diligent Person, and expects that I will apply
many hours in the day. Our affairs go on very prosperously
and in great order, so that I have as little
trouble as is possible in a case where so many and
large accounts are to be look’d over.</p>

<p>“... It is said that gaming is carried on with
greater spirit among the fine people than ever was
known. I desire my most affectionate compliments
to my brothers of Horton, Denton and Canterbury....
My best love to ye dear little ones who adorn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
your fireside, and best wishes for the year begun, and
for all succeeding years, to the parents and the babes.”</p>

<p>It was in this year, 1774, that Mrs. Montagu wrote
the following to Mrs. Robinson, from Sandleford,
September the 5th, 1774:</p>

<p>“... I had intended writing to you as soon as I
could get a frank.... All frothy matter takes up a
great deal of space, and my letters always run over
the fourth side and incur double taxes at the post-office.
By mistake I had left my franks to you in
London, so I waited till I could see Mr. Congreve, the
only member of Parliament in our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>“... The wet weather has hurt me as a valetudinarian,
and mortified me as a farmer, so that I cannot
say, in the pert fashionable phrase, it has not
made me sick nor sorry, but more of the first than the
last, and not greatly either.... We have a prodigious
crop of barley, and there seems to be a great
plenty of it everywhere, and yet the maltsters are contracting
for it already at 30<i>s.</i> per quarter. I suppose
the ensuing elections will raise the price of malt. I
wish our poor people ate more and drank less.</p>

<p>“I am extremely mortified at Lord Mahone’s too
great vivacity. Lord Stanhope brought him to Tunbridge
to spend a day with me. I was pleased
with his conversation and manners, and particularly
in not finding him so exotick as I expected. His
sentiments and language appear to me perfectly
good English, such as suited the heir of an English
peer, and not borrow’d from <i>un bourgeois de
Genève</i>, which, with all due respect to Jean Jacques,
I take to be much inferior in nobleness of mind as
well as dignity of office. But his lordship’s attack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
on Mr. Knight and his presenting articles to a candidate,
looks as if he had steep’d his patriotism in
the Lake of Geneva. Lord Stanhope is a very
respectable man; has great virtues and great talents.
These, under the military discipline of worldly warfare,
do great things, while they lead and command
regiments of inferior minds which fight under them.
But in our days the unconnected patriot makes just
such a figure in the political system as the <i>preux</i>
chevalier would do now in the military. Nothing
is to be done in these days by single combat.
Neither the patriot nor the champion would be able
to effect the abolition of the exorbitant toll of a
bridge. If I had a son, I should desire him never
to wander single in quest of adventures. Virtue,
wisdom, honours, prosperity, happiness, are all to be
found on the turnpike road, or not to be found at
all....</p>

<p>“I had strong inclinations to make you and my
brother at Horton a visit when I left Tunbridge;
but as a northern journey was then in contemplation,
I durst not propose such a measure to Mr. Montagu.
He still talks of our going to Northumberland, but
delays setting out. In the meantime, winter
approaches. He is in very good health and spirits,
but extremely feeble; goes to bed every afternoon
by five o’clock, and seems by no means equal to so
fatiguing a journey; so I hope it will end in talk....
Mr. Montagu loves delay so well, he intends not
to set out till a fortnight after me. He did not leave
London till the middle of August, tho’ he had not any
business to detain him.</p>

<p>“... If I had children, I should be much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
solicitous about their temper than talents. As many
hours in the day as a man of the finest parts is
peevish or in a passion, he is more contemptible than
a blockhead, and suffers (though he does not know
it) the internal scorn and contempt of every rational
creature that is in good humour. We are, too, much
earlier able to judge of a child’s temper than capacity.
Minds ripen at very different ages. If the understanding
is naturally slow, preceptors should be patient,
and not put it too much out of its natural pace. Some
children apprehend quick; others acquire everything
with difficulty. In the latter case, they should be
encouraged, led, and not driven.”</p>

<p>Miss Gregory (a friend and companion of the
writer) was very much liked at Cambridge. “Her
sweet temper, good sense, and elegant simplicity of
manners much charm every one who is well acquainted
with her. She is perfectly free from missy
pertnesses, airs, and minanderies, which put many of
our girls of fashion upon a line with milliners’
apprentices. Though she has lived so much with
me I never saw her out of humour. She seems as
pleased with retirement as in a publick place; and
is as sober and discreet in a publick place as in
retirement.</p>

<p>“There is a report that Captain Darby is going to
be married to a widow worth fourscore thousand
pounds. It seems her first husband was a good-humoured,
quiet, dull man. <i>Elle s’en trouvait bien</i>,
and is going to take such another; but still, fourscore
thousand pounds is a great price for a dull man....
Miss Snell is married to a gentleman of good character
and six thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“I beg my best respects and most affectionate
compliments to my brother Robinson. Will he never
let us have the pleasure of seeing him? I wish he
would visit the farmer and farmeress of Sandleford.”</p>

<p>In the course of the above year, 1774, when an
invitation to Mrs. Montagu’s house in Hill Street was
not lightly sent and was highly esteemed, she despatched
a card of invitation to Doctor Johnson. The
philosopher neither went to her assembly nor acknowledged
the invitation. In a subsequent apologetic
note, he said: “Having committed one fault by inadvertency,
I will not commit another by sullenness....
The favour of your notice can never miss a
suitable return but from ignorance or thoughtlessness;
and to be ignorant of your eminence is not
easy but to him who lives out of reach of the public
voice.” Allegiance could not be more perfect! But
Mrs. Montagu was not influenced by it, when, in
1775, she settled a small annuity on Doctor Johnson’s
friend, Mrs. Williams, saving her from misery; for
which rescue Mrs. Williams expressed her thanks in
words almost of divine adoration. Doctor Johnson
was moved by the generous act, when he subsequently
heard that Mrs. Montagu was in town, ill.
He wrote like a gallant. “To have you detained
among us by sickness is to enjoy your presence at too
dear a rate.” He wishes she may be “so well as
to be able to leave us, and so kind as not to be willing.”...
Here is more: “All that the esteem and
reverence of mankind can give you, are already
yours; and the little I can add to the voice of nations
will not much exalt. Of that little, however, you are,
I hope, very certain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>The poor lady had now more serious matters
claiming her attention than quarrels or compliments
with Johnson. Her kind-hearted and now aged
husband had long been slowly dying. His last hour
seemed now approaching. In May, 1775, Mrs. Chapone,
in a letter to Mrs. Delany, described Mrs.
Montagu as being “in a most distressful situation.”
Mr. Montagu, “instead of sinking easily, as might
have been expected from so long and gradual a decline,
suffers great struggle, and has a fever attended
with deliriums, which are most dreadfully affecting to
Mrs. Montagu. If this scene should continue, I
tremble for the effects of it on her tender frame; but
I think it must very soon have an end, and she will
then reconcile herself to a loss so long expected, tho’
I doubt not she will feel it very sincerely. He is
entitled to her highest esteem and gratitude, and, I
believe, possesses them both.”</p>

<p>The aged philomath might have been the original
of the legendary mathematician, who, having been
induced to read “Paradise Lost,” asked, on reaching
the last line of the poem, “Well, what does it prove?”
Mr. Montagu’s wonted fires and ruling passion partook
exclusively of a mathematical ardour. His
wife, who had, previous to her husband’s fatal illness,
passed from the most sincere spirit of free inquiry
into the equally sincere acceptance of orthodoxy, was
very anxious that her husband should be of the same
faith with herself before they were parted for ever.
She begged Beattie to effect this desired consummation,
if it were possible. The aged mathematician
was too much, however, for the minister and his
clever wife together. “To her great concern,” says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Beattie, in a letter to Doctor Laing, “he set too
much value on mathematical evidence, and piqued
himself too much on his knowledge in that science.
He took it into his head, too, that I was a mathematician,
though I was at a great deal of pains to convince
him to the contrary.” Mr. Montagu died in
May, 1775. The poor gentleman’s death was immediately
made the opportunity for speculation on the
part of his friends, as to the prospects of his widow.
“Mr. Edward Montagu is dead,” wrote Mrs. Delany.
“He has left his widow everything, both real and
personal: only charging it with a legacy of £3,000.
If her heart prove as good as her head, she may do
an abundance of good. Her possessions are very
great.” Walpole speculated in another fashion on
this gentleman’s demise. He wrote to Mason:
“The husband of Mrs. Montagu, of Shakespearshire,
is dead, and has left her an estate of £7,000 a year in
her own power. Will you come and be candidate for
her hand? I conclude it will be given to a champion
at some Olympic games; and were I she, I would
sooner marry you than Pindar!”</p>

<p>Johnson fully illustrated the charitable side of Mrs.
Montagu’s character, when he said, in 1776, in reply
to a hint that her liberality was pharisaical, “I have
seen no beings who do as much good from benevolence
as she does from whatever motive.” Johnson
subsequently was less charitable and less accurate.
Mrs. Montagu’s letters abound with references to
her complete ignorance of Greek and her small
knowledge of Latin. “But,” said Johnson, “she is
willing you should think she knows them, but she
does not say she does.” A hundred times she wrote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
that she did not. Johnson’s were hardly the “respectful
sentiments” he professed to have when he
begged for a copy of her engraved portrait, as a
reward for his love and adoration.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu respected her gentle husband’s
memory in the way he would have approved—by
attending to the business which his death left on her
hands. She withdrew to Sandleford, not to cover
her face, but to woo the fresh air. She then travelled
to Denton Castle, to plunge into occupation,
and to show her steward that her recent grief had
not rendered her insensible to her interests. From
the castle, or hall (it is called by both names), she
wrote on July the 10th, 1775, the following, not at
all woebegone, but sensible, letter to her sister-in-law:</p>

<p>“... I know your good-nature will have suggested
to you, and accepted as an excuse for my
long delay of writing, the various business which my
present situation occasions. My long and very melancholy
confinement much affected my health and
spirits. The fresh air and constant exercise at
Sandleford proved of great service to me, and encouraged
me to venture on a much longer journey.
On the 30th of June, I set out on my expedition to
Northumberland, and, on the 3d of July, at noon,
I got as far as my estate at Burniston. Exactly opposite
to some of my land, there is a tolerable inn.
I eat a hasty dinner, and taking my steward with me,
went over as many of the farms as I could that night,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
and sent invitations to my tenants to dine with me
the next day.</p>

<p>“Mine Host, by sending to the neighbouring markets,
assembled together sirloins of beef, legs of
mutton, loins of veal, chickens, ducks, and green
peas, which, with ham, pigeon-pie, tarts, and custard,
fill’d up every chink of table, and, I believe, of
stomach. Unfortunately, there was not a room large
enough to contain all my good friends, so the women
and the young lasses dined with me, and the men
with the steward.</p>

<p>“As Mr. Montagu had been always a very good
landlord, I thought it right to show the good people
they would have a kind landlady, and therefore I
would not pass by without taking notice of them.
Several of them enquired after the young gentlemen
that came from Horton to Allerthorpe. I assured
them Mr. William Robinson was a profound divine,
and Mr. Charles a sage counsellor at law. They rejoyced
that Master Willie was happy in a good and
rich wife, and had three fine Bairns. In the evening
I went on to Darlington, where part of my estates
come down to the turnpike road. I stopped at a
tenant’s who has a pretty large house, desired them
to dress a dinner the next day for me and my tenants....
Darlington was rather too far for the women to
reach. I lay at Darlington, and early ye next day
went over to this Estate, and passed the whole day
there with great pleasure. A fine, rapid river, woody
bank, and some of the most stately oaks and beech
in Yorkshire, would recommend it sufficiently to the
eye that does not behold it with the complacency of
a proprietor, and you will believe it loses nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
of its charms by that circumstance. After dinner I
wandered again about the place, visited most of my
tenants’ houses, and did not take leave of Eryholme
(?) till night drew her sable curtain, which gave me
occasion to recollect that the day of my life must
soon close, and all these things be hid from me; but
if I make a proper use of them while they are mine,
it is all I ought to be solicitous for, as I am not
amongst those unhappy Persons whose views are
bounded to the short day of human life.</p>

<p>“I was much pleased with all my tenants in Yorkshire.
They are a very different sort of people from
the farmers in ye south. They are alert in their
business and interests, and far from the stupid state
of savage. At the same time, they do not ape the
manners nor imitate the dress of the fine folks.
The farmer’s wife spins her husband’s shirts, and the
daughters make butter and cheese at the hours our
southern women work catgut and dress wire caps.
Some of my tenants have been about fifty years on
the estate; have married their sons to girls worth
many hundred pounds, and have got their sons into
their farms, and they are retired on a decent subsistance,
gained by many years of frugal industry. They
all pay duely on their rent-days. No complaint, on
the part of the tenants, of poverty; or, on the landlord,
of arrears. The land is in good condition, and
by having been long settled, they have acquired an
affection for the farm they are placed upon, and will
always give as good a rent as it deserves; and they
know the nature of the undertaking too well to give
more. It is a folly to let farms too cheap; and it is
both wickedness and folly to let them too dear. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
year has been particularly unfavourable to my tenants,
as the estates are chiefly meadow and pasture;
and yet, though these estates had been lately raised,
they did not ask any indulgence or favour. They
said there had not been such a dry season these fifty
years; and, with great good-humour, said they hoped
the next would be better. Indeed, the drought is
terrible for the dairy-farms. Hay here will be at an
excessive price. The coal-owners who are not provident
with stocks of it will be at vast expenses. I
have always two years’ stock in hand. The further
north, the greater the drought. I believe there has
not been any material rain since the 18th of March.
Cows there (and here) are obliged to be driven to the
rivers to drink. Our little streams are all dry’d.
My cows go every day to the Tyne to get drink.
The Tyne Vale, where I live, used to look green and
pleasant. The whole country is now a brown crust,
with here and there a black hole of a coal-pit, so that
I cannot boast of the beauty of our prospects. As
to Denton, it has mightily the air of an ant-hill: a
vast many black animals for ever busy. Near fourscore
families are employ’d on my concerns here.
Boys work in the colliery from seven years of age.
I used to give my colliery people a feast when I came
hither, but as the good souls (men and women) are
very apt to get drunk, and, when drunk, very joyful,
and sing, and dance, and hollow, and whoop, I dare
not, on this occasion, trust their discretion to behave
with proper gravity; so I content myself with killing
a fat beast once a week, and sending to each family,
once, a piece of meat. It will take time to get round
to all my black friends. I had fifty-nine boys and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
girls to sup in the courtyard last night on rice pudding
and boil’d beef; to-morrow night I shall have as
many. It is very pleasant to see how the poor things
cram themselves, and the expense is not great. We
buy rice cheap, and skimmed milk and coarse beef
serve the occasion. Some have more children than
their labour will cloathe, and on such I shall bestow
some apparel. Some benefits of this sort, and a
general kind behaviour, gives to the coal-owner, as
well as to them, a good deal of advantage. Our pitmen
are afraid of being turned off, and that fear keeps
an order and regularity amongst them that is very
uncommon.</p>

<p>“The general coal trade and my concerns in it
are, at present, in a thriving way, and if all goes
on so well two years longer, and I live till then,
I will establish a spinning, knitting, and sewing-school
for ye girls. When I say establish, I mean
for my life, for one cannot be charitable longer.
When the night cometh, no man can work. Charitable
institutions soon fall into neglect and abuse.
I made a visit at Burniston to my Uncle Robinson’s
almshouses. I gave each of the old people a guinea.
I have sometimes sent them money; for what my
uncle appointed near a hundred years ago is hardly
a subsistence. Indeed, they would starve if they had
not some helps.</p>

<p>“I have not been one moment ill since I set out
on my journey. I walk about my farms, and down
to my colliery, like a country gentlewoman of the last
century. I rejoyce in the great improvement of my
land here by good cultivation, but I do not like
my tenants so well as those in Yorkshire. We are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
here a little too rustick, and speak a dialect that is
dreadful to the auditor’s nerves; and as to the
colliery, I cannot yet reconcile myself to seeing my
fellow creatures descend into the dark regions of the
earth; tho’, to my great comfort, I hear them singing
in the pits.... If I did not think you kindly interested
yourself, I would not trouble you with this
long history of myself.</p>

<p>“I had the pleasure of seeing my neice in great
good-humour, beauty, and health; and these are
the fairest features of youth. Long may they
dimple and bloom on her cheek. I approve much
of my little nephews going to a school of a private
sort at first. I think boys of a gentle and bashful
disposition are discouraged at being thrust at once
into the prodigious racket of a great school....</p>

<p>“I think my sister Scott greatly mended by James’s
powders. I was very uneasy about her before she
went to Bath, but Doctor Moisy has done great things
for her.... I have not seen her look so well for
some years.... I expect Doctor Beattie and his
wife every day. I propose to return to the south
the end of this month, in order to take some weeks
at Tunbridge.... I believe I shall pass the winter
in the south of France, but have not yet determined,
as all human projects are uncertain; but it is my wish
to do so.”</p>

<p>Illness delayed the realisation of this wish. Mrs.
Montagu was in Hill Street in November, receiving
only a few of her most intimate friends. “I called
on Mrs. Montagu,” writes Mrs. Boscawen to Mrs.
Delany, in the above month; “only Lady Townshend
was there, and in her best way, very chatty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>In 1775-76, among the visitors at Bath occasionally
seen by Mrs. Scott, was a little lame Scottish
boy, between four and five years old. When he
had bathed in the morning, got through a reading-lesson
at an old dame’s near his lodging on the
Parade, and had a drive over the Downs with the
author of “Douglas” and Mrs. Home, the boy was
sometimes to be seen in the boxes of the old theatre.
On one such occasion, witnessing “As You Like It,”
his interest was so great that, in the middle of the
wrestling-scene in the first act, he called out, “A’n’t
they brothers?” The boy, when he had become a
man, said in his autobiography, “A few weeks’
residence at home convinced me, who had till then
been an only child in the house of my grandfather,
that a quarrel between brothers was a very natural
event.” This boy’s name was Walter Scott. Much
of the other company at Bath was then about to
withdraw from the stage which the boy was to
occupy with such glory to himself, and to the lasting
delight of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The year 1778 opens with the following letter to
Mrs. Robinson: “... I wish I could thank you for
your letter in as fair characters as my neice returned
hers for the books. I have ostentatiously shewed
her letter to many of my friends. My sister and I
have not let my brother share in the honour; for
we confess no Robinson ever wrote so well; so that
she inherits this, with many other good things, from
her Mama. If she can compose a sermon as well as her
brother, and writes it in her own hand, it will retrieve
the honour of manuscript-sermons, which of late years
have sold cheaper than even any other goods....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“The town is very empty, and I know not how
we who are here contrive to be as much engaged as
at other seasons. The Bath has been very full of
persons of distinction.</p>

<p>“Lord Villiers (the prince of maccaronies) gave, a
few days ago, a play in a Barn. He acted Lord
Townley; Miss Hodges, Lady Townley. I suppose
the merit of this entertainment was, that people were
to go many miles, in frost and snow, to see in a barn
what would have been every way better at the theatre
in Drury Lane or Covent Garden. There was a ball
also prepared after the play, but the barn had so
benumbed the vivacity of the company, and the
beaux’ feet were so cold, and the noses of the belles
were so blue, many retired to a warm bed at the inn
at Henley, instead of partaking of the dance. M.
Texier acted M. Pigmaleon, and Miss Hodges the
Statue. Modern nymphs are so warm and yielding,
that less art than that of M. Texier might have animated
the nymph. My neice will never stand still
to be made love to before a numerous audience.
Miss Hodges’ father is lately dead; her mother
is dying. How many indecorums the girl has
brought together into one petite peice!</p>

<p>“I dare not send you any publick news, as my
brothers are engaged to the Congress and American
Independency.</p>

<p>“I think the fine world goes on as usual at this
time of the year. ‘Caractacus’ has succeeded very
well on the stage, tho’ it is more calculated for the
study than the theatre.</p>

<p>“Our French ambassador pleases all people, of
course, by his conversation and manners. By his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
splendour of living and polite attentions at table, he
charms the great vulgar; so that he is in general
esteem, and, indeed, deserves to be so. He dined
with us ye other day, and I am to dine with him on
Sunday. Mme. de Noailles cannot come to me till
she is brought to bed. She is extremely sensible and
agreable.</p>

<p>“Lord Granby very thoughtlessly carried his lady
to Brussels, on a jaunt of amusement, soon after she
was brought to bed, and, by getting cold, she is
most dangerously ill. She is much better; but the
duchess dowager is so uneasy about her, I am afraid
we shall not be able to dissuade her from going to
Brussels, tho’ this weather makes sea voyages and,
indeed, land journeys very terrible.</p>

<p>“... My brother Charles told me the good folks
in Kent were angry with me or your consort for
making a justice of peace of Doctor Pennington; but,
indeed, I never heard the doctor had an ambition to
be of the worshipful quorum till my brother mentioned
it. As it is not Greek and Hebrew, but lands
and tenements and such solid property, which give a
title to be justice of peace, I should not in any way
have assisted the doctor’s project, if I had had it in
my power. I am so far from being a favourer of the
Alliance of Church and State, I think the further
they keep asunder the better—a two-edged sword
is a terrible weapon.”</p>

<p>In the summer of 1776, Mrs. Montagu was to be
seen in Paris, welcomed to the first circles as a happy
sample of an accomplished English lady. Voltaire,
then in his dotage, took the opportunity of her
presence to send to the Academy a furious paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
against Shakespeare. The lady had a seat of honour
among the audience while the vituperative paper was
read. When the reading came to an end, Suard
remarked to her, “I think, madam, you must be
rather sorry at what you have just heard!” The
English lady, Voltaire’s old adversary, promptly replied,
“I, sir! not at all. I am not one of M.
Voltaire’s friends!” She subsequently wrote: “I
felt the same indignation and scorn, at the reading of
Voltaire’s paper, as I should have done if I had
seen harlequin cutting capers and striking his wooden
sword on the monument of a Cæsar or Alexander the
Great.”</p>

<p>In October, after her return to Hill Street, she
thus described to Garrick the influence exercised
over her by French tragedy and French tragedians:</p>

<p>“... Mrs. M—— cannot help intimating that she
never felt such pity and terror, which it is the business
of tragedy to excite, as at the French theatre,
where M. le Kain roars like a mad bull, and Molé
rolls his eyes, and has all the appearance of a man in
a phrensy ... persons of real taste seem convinced
of the false taste prevalent in their tragedies.”</p>

<p>The “flutter of Paris” was almost more than her
strength could bear. The idea of its being succeeded
by the “racket of London” alarmed her. She avoided
the “racket,” and recovered from the “flutter,” by
spending a season of rest at Sandleford, where she
dreamed over Voltaire’s address against Shakespeare,
became a rural cottager, feeder of pigs, cultivator of
potatoes, or pretended to be so, and “did idleness.”
“There is as much an idleness to be done,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
wrote to Garrick, “as there is a darkness that may be
visible, and is, like the other, a state and a condition,
and a very pleasant and gentle one, when the working-day
of bustle and hurry is over.... I came to
do idleness, and it is not all done.”</p>

<p>The visit to Paris is alluded to among an “infinite
deal” of other subjects, in a letter to her brother
William, dated Sandleford, June 9, 1777.</p>

<p>“It would be with much greater pleasure I should
take up my pen to tell you I am at Sandleford, if I
could flatter myself with the hope of alluring you to
it: you would find me in the character of a housewife.
The meagre condition of the soil forbids me
to live in the state of a shepherdess-queen, which I
look upon as the highest rural dignity. The plough,
the harrow, and the spade remind us that the golden
age is past, and subsistence depends on labour;
prosperity on industrious application. A little of the
clay of which you complain, would do us a great deal
of good. I should be glad to take my dominions
here from the goddess Ceres to give them to the god
Pan, and I think you will agree with me in that taste;
for wherever he presides, there Nature’s republick is
establish’d. The ox in his pasture is as free and as
much at his ease as the proprietor of the soil, and
the days of the first are not more shorten’d to feed
the intemperance of others, than the rich landlord’s
by the indulgence of his own. I look upon the
goddess Ceres as a much less impartial and universally
kind deity. The antients thought they did
her honour by ascribing to her the invention of laws.
We must consider her also as the mother of lawsuits
and all the divisions, dissentions, and distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
among mankind. Naturalists tell us all the oaks that
have ever been, were contain’d in the first acorn. I
believe we may affirm, by the same mode of reasoning,
that all arts and sciences were contain’d in the
first ear of corn. To possess lasting treasure and
exclusive prosperity, has been the great business
and aim of man. At Sandleford you will find us
busy in the care of arable land. By two little purchases
Mr. Montagu made here, my farm contains six
hundred acres. As I now consider it an amazonian
land, I affect to consider the women as capable of
assisting in agriculture as much as the men. They
weed my corn, hoe my turnips, and set my Pottatoes;
and by these means promote the prosperity of their
families. A landlord, where the <i>droit du seigneur</i>
prevailed, would not expose the complexions of his
female vassals to the sun. I must confess my amazons
hardly deserve to be accounted of the fair
sex; and they have not the resources of pearl-powder
and rouge when the natural lilies and roses have
faded.</p>

<p>“You are very polite in supposing my looks not so
homely as I described them; but tho’ my health is
good, the faded roses do not revive, and I assure you
I am always of the colour of <i>la feuille-morte</i>. My
complexion has long fallen into the sere and yellow
leaf; and I assure you one is as much warned against
using art, by seeing the ladies of Paris, as the Spartan
youths by observing the effects of intoxicating
liquors on the Helots. The vast quantity of rouge
worn there by the fine ladies makes them hideous.
As I always imagine one is less looked at by wearing
the uniform of the society one lives in, I allowed my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
frizeuse to put on whatever rouge was usually worn.
But a few years ago, I believe, my vanity could not
have submitted to such a disfiguration. As soon as
I got to Dover, I return’d to my former complexion.
I own I think I could make that complexion a little
better by putting on a little rouge; but at my age,
any appearance of solicitude about complexion is
absurd, and therefore I remain where age and former
ill health have brought me; and rejoice that I enjoy
the comforts of health, tho’ depriv’d of its pleasing
looks.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to find my neice has recovered
her health. I was much afraid of a consumption for
her.... It has given me great pleasure to hear
your health is pretty good, ... but if St. Anthony’s
fire should menace, remember that his distemper, as
well as his temptation, is most dangerous in a desart
or wilderness, and repair to the city of Bath. Tho’
I say this, I was never in my life more sensible of the
charms of rural life and the blessings of tranquility,
but at the same time I am sensible that my relish of
them is much quickened by having been for a twelvemonth
past in a very different mode of life. I regret
very much that the emperor did not come to Paris
last summer, tho’ I suppose, among the French nobility,
I met with men as polite; among the academicians,
with men more learned, ingenious, and witty;
yet, as I am a Virtuoso in what relates to the human
character, and love to see how it appears in various
situations, I should have seen an emperor, as an emperor
is an unique in human society at present; and
the Austrian family has always had a strongly-marked
personal character. All my French correspondents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
assure me that his Imperial Majesty veils his dignity
on all occasions under the character of Count de Falkenstein.
He sleeps at his ambassador’s, but dines
with the two noblemen of his Court who attend him
at an <i>Hôtel garnie</i>. When he goes to Versailles to
visit his sister, he refuses to lodge in the palace, and
lodges at a bagnio. He goes sometimes to Versailles
in his coach; at others, in a fiacre, or walks. The
French, who are much struck with everything that is
new, are full of wonder and respect at the publick spectacles.
They give a thunder of applause whenever he
appears. In private society, his Majesty is easy and
affable, and, by what I can understand, glad to show
he is more conversant in the common affairs of common
life than princes usually are. The objects of
his curiosity and the subjects of his discourse are
such as seem to indicate he is a man of sense.
Whether he has talents for empire, time must show.
Without understanding the doctrine of chances as
well as Demeri (?), one may pronounce the chances
are nearly infinite he has not. I am glad, however,
princes begin to travel. One has a chance of meeting
these itinerant monarchs somewhere; and they
amuse, at least, as well as stuff’d eagles or lions in a
museum. I was in great hopes that you would have
come to town to hear Lord Chatham, in support of
his motion, the other day.”</p>

<p>In the following month, the letter below was written
at Sandleford, July the 9th, 1777:</p>

<p>“... As she” (one of Mrs. Montagu’s nieces)
“was not the worse for the ball, I am glad she partook
of the pleasure of it. If she resembles a certain
Miss Robinson who lived in the neighbourhood some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
years ago, she will reckon a ball amongst the first
enjoyments of human life. Considering her state of
health, I do not know whether it was very prudent
in her brother to carry her there, but I am sure it
was very amiable; the error should always be rather
on the side of indulgence. We should consider that,
though there will be dancing as long as the world
endures, it is but a short time that an individual will
dance.</p>

<p>“... The warmth of the weather prevented my
seeing the ‘School for Scandal,’ but every one agrees
with you to commend it. Of all the vices of the
human disposition, a love of scandal and detraction is
the most contemptible. It is now got from the gossips’
tea-table to the press. The scriblers weekly let
fly their pop-guns at the Duchess of Devonshire’s
feathers. Her grace is innocent, good-humoured, and
beautifull; but these adders are blind and deaf, and
cannot be charmed. However, the scriblers are all
of them hungry; but the circulators of scandal, who
have neither hunger for their excuse, nor wit to give
it a seasoning, are sad vermin, and I am glad Mr.
Sheridan has so well exposed them.</p>

<p>“The uncertainty of human life is certainly a discouragement
to every enterprize, but to none less, I
think, than to building a house. If it is a good one,
there will be somebody to live in it and enjoy its
comforts; if otherwise, its inconveniences will not
make one uneasy in the tomb. To undertake a trust
which, by not fulfilling, may be detrimental to some
person; to bring children into the world when it is
too late in life to hope to see them educated and
established, are things about which a prudent person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
may hesitate; but even in this case, we can never do
wrong when we follow the general principles by which
the author of our nature has intended we should be
directed. The shortness and uncertainty of life
would discourage all great undertakings; and, as the
human race is to continue, providence has ordered we
should act as if we were to live for ever.</p>

<p>“We have had a series of the worst weather I ever
knew since I came here, at this time of year. Sir
William Temple says, the three greatest blessings are
health, peace, and fine weather. The first two are the
most important and I have enjoyed them in so perfect
a degree, that I have well endured the want of
the third. Doctor Robinson’s ‘History of America’
has amused me by my fireside, when wind and rain
have combined against my amusements abroad. A
long deprivation of the quiet joys of rural life gave
me a quick relish for them. If I had staid in town,
the great numbers of foreigners who have lately
arrived there, who have all brought letters of recommendation
to me, or who would have been naturally
introduced by my previous acquaintance with them
abroad, must have taken up much of my time and
attention.</p>

<p>“Lord Shelburne called here the other day to
invite me to Bowood, to meet l’Abbé Raynal, who I
knew at Paris, and two French countesses who
brought letters to me from some of the <i>beaux esprits</i>
there; so to them I shall have an opportunity of expressing
my regret at being out of town. But there
is a Spanish Baron de Castile and some others who
were also recommended to me, who I fear will depart
with a bad opinion of my hospitality; for, twenty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
one, my English porter in Hill Street could not make
them understand, when they delivered their letters,
that I was in the country. At present my scheme is
to go to London for the melancholy pleasure of taking
leave of the Lord Primate and my friend Mrs.
Vesey.... When these friends leave London, I believe
I shall set out for Mount Edgecumbe, having
long promised Lady Edgecumbe a visit, and shall
carry Montagu with me, who is a schoolfellow of
Mr. Edgecumbe, and is much invited.... Mr. and
Mrs. Vesey are going to Mr. Burke’s, at Beaconsfield,
who has kindly asked me to be of the party; but I
shall be a good while absent from Sandleford, and
have many domestick matters to settle before I depart.
I had a most polite, entertaining letter the
other day from my Brother Robinson. I wish we
two honest farmers lived nearer together with brotherly
love and rural sincerity. I flatter myself we
should be very happy; but in this short life, how
short a time does one enjoy the friends one loves.</p>

<p>“... In spite of my cure and Doctor Fothergill’s
skill, I have made but a poor progress towards
health.... My nerves mend, but I cannot better
bear the noise of a cannon now than I could the report
of a pistol when I first return’d to Hill Street.
My doctor keeps me very quiet. He will not allow
me to see the wise, the witty, or the fashionable
world. I have not dined below stairs these four or
five days. The doctor has to-day begun to try a
new medicine; but I have as little faith in doctors of
physick as some of my family have in doctors of
divinity. I imagine my fever at Canterbury was the
influenza, which has lately raged so much. It leaves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
people very weak, and much affects the nerves. Some
have lost their speech for a few days; others their
hearing. My Northumberland steward and my
brother who left London when I did, were both taken
ill on the road. I believe fatigue of preparation for
my foreign journey did me some harm; but I believe
my principal illness was owing to contagion in the
air. My servants have all been sick. None of my
family have escaped but Miss Gregory and Matt.</p>

<p>“The patriots are rather in despair of changing the
ministry. This may damp their ambition, but will
keep their patriotism in its vigour. There is something
so mortal to patriotism in a place, that one can
never wish those who have assumed that character to
sacrifice it to the emoluments of an employment....</p>

<p>“Mr. Burke is kept from the House of Commons
by the death of his father-in-law. Lady Mary Somerset
has recovered her health, and her nuptials will
soon be celebrated. Hymen may exult, for the pair
are lovely. Miss Gregory often spends the evening
with Lady Mary and Lady Betty. As Lord Granby
is of the party, you may suppose Lady Betty and
Miss Gregory attend most to each other.... Tell
my neice I have not forgotten her doll, but have not
been well enough to accomplish an affair of such importance
as dressing a lady. My nephews both shall
come with the doll, thus teaching by allegory, that
men are to be learned, and ladies elegant.”</p>

<p>In Mrs. Scott’s letter which now follows, the details
refer to the death of the brother most dearly
loved by both his sisters—Morris Robinson, who
married Jane, daughter of John Greenland, of Lovelace.
His two sons, Morris and Matthew, succeeded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
in the order indicated, to the barony of Rokeby.
Matthew was at this time domiciled with Mrs. Montagu,
whose name he had taken as her acknowledged
heir.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott to Mrs. Robinson. “<i>November 16, 1777.</i> ...
The world has indeed become a very different
scene to me since we parted. It has lost the greatest
charm it had for me. The loss is not only a brother,
but, as Solomon expresses it, that friend that was
more than a brother, one with whom I had lived full
forty years in the tenderest affection, in the most perfect
harmony; never interrupted even by a mere dispute,
except on his first connexion with his present
widow. It is totally irreparable. I own I loved
nothing so well; and though I am not so new to misfortune
as not to have learnt to bear patiently, and to
see, while I lament the loss of a blessing, that I ought
to be grateful for having so long enjoyed one so uncommon;
yet the sense of it must ever lie a sorrow
at my heart. There was a loveliness of nature in him
that I never saw equalled.... I do not think he
had a fault, except the weakness of complying with
one who was not satisfied with that degree of expense
which was proper for them; and for that he might
make the same excuse that the great Duke of Marlborough
did when told he was too complying a husband:
‘Friend, can a man live without sleep?’ His
own disposition did not lead him either to vanity or
extravagance. I confess, therefore, he was guilty of a
weakness, but it was one founded on the extreme
sweetness of his temper; an unfortunate effect of a
most amiable cause. However, she to whom it is
owing is now much to be pitied. She would not believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
what he frequently told her, but is now sadly
awakened to the truth of it.”</p>

<p>In the subjoined fragment of a letter from Mrs.
Montagu, reference is made to the Scotch thief and
deserter, John Aitkin, the incendiary, otherwise
known as Jack the painter, who was hanged, in 1777,
for attempting to set fire to Portsmouth Dockyard
and shipping.</p>

<p>“... I was mortified to hear the dreadful box
which was intended to destroy Portsmouth was made
at the respectable city of Canterbury. Mr. Silas
Deane will make no very respectable figure when John
Painter’s story is produced in public. If Doctor
Franklin had been an incendiary, he would have been
a more dangerous man than Mr. Deane; for you
know he can bottle up lightning; but philosophers are
honester men than politicians.... Lord Temple has
been very useful in getting this horrid affair of John
the painter brought to light.... Doctor Dodd’s affair
is almost forgot. Some suppose that for want of
some formality on his trial, he will escape hanging.
Lord Chesterfield has behaved with great kindness
to the doctor’s brother, who is a worthy man, and to
Mrs. Dodd’s nephew....</p>

<p>“The match between Lord Powis and Miss Warren
is not to take place, the young lady having expressed
a predilection for Lord Bulkely, who is to have her.</p>

<p>“Lady Strathmore’s conduct at Newcastle, in the
election, is, perhaps, not generally known. Her ladyship
sits all day in the window at a public-house, from
whence she sometimes lets fall some jewels or trinkets,
which voters pick up, and then she gives them
money for restoring them—a new kind of offering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
bribes. What little interest I have I gave to Sir John
Trevelyan, who, we hope, will carry the election by a
good majority. My steward tells me he is very
weary of the bustle and treating the voters; and that
the town is in a wild uproar. Mr. Stoney Bowes has
sold £5,000 a year of his lady’s income for her life to
procure himself £40,000. I believe this gentleman
will revenge the wrongs Lord Strathmore suffered
from her ladyship. It is said Sir Thomas Robinson
died worth above £10,000, but it is supposed he
has left it to his natural daughter.”</p>

<p>Lady Strathmore had the misfortune to be an heiress,
Mary Eleanor Bowes. Lord Strathmore took
her, her money, and her name, in 1767. In nine
years he was removed by death; his widow soon after
married Mr. Stoney, an Irish heiress-hunter, who
adopted the name of Bowes, and thoroughly avenged
the wrongs and sufferings of the first husband. But
Stoney Bowes was sorely mauled in the cruel and
scandalous struggle. It is a disgraceful story, from
which the reader may well turn to a few plain lines
from Mrs. Scott, in a fragment of a letter of this
date: “I shall be very glad of my niece’s company
on her way to Whitelands, and if I can find out any
amusement for her, she shall have it. Plays, which
I think are the best, it is so difficult for those to get
places at, who do not give largely to the box-keepers,
that I am discouraged from attempting, by having no
hopes of success (but I shall try when my niece comes),
tho’ I feel no degradation to my dignity from sitting
in a front box, and like it just as well as the side, if
not further back than the second row. I went with my
sister to ‘Percy,’ and that is the only one I have seen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>The side boxes ranked then as the orchestra stalls
do now—the most fashionable, but among the very
worst seats in the house. Mrs. Montagu, in the
letter opening the next chapter, takes her correspondent
to houses of a more agreeable quality.</p>

<p>“Sandleford, <i>September 26, 1778</i>.... Nuneham
is a very fine place, and the owners of it are so
amiable and agreable, that one passes one’s time
very pleasantly. It sometimes resembles a congress
of all the ambassadors in Europe; for Lord Harcourt,
having been in a publick capacity, all the ambassadors,
and, indeed, all the foreigners of distinction
come thither. I remember passing three days there
once without hearing a syllable of English spoken.
Had every one of the company spoken his mother
tongue, it would have resembled Babel. Monsieur
and Madame de Noailles are most agreable persons,
and I wish we may not have any other foreigners
while they stay.</p>

<p>“... I do not know any one who makes his house
so agreable to his friends as my brother (William).
His parts and knowledge make him an excellent
companion; and his apparent benevolence, integrity,
and virtues endear his talents.... I agree entirely
with the Primate that your rev. consort would grace
a Stall; but he is of so unambitious a spirit, I believe
he will not take any pains to get into one. Dean of
Canterbury would suit him very well. A dean is not
obliged to fast or pray, nor has the troublesome care
of any soul but his own.</p>

<p>“... We are now very busy with the harvest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
We had a great deal of hay, and, fortunately, very
little of it was spoiled. We have a prodigious crop
of Wheat this year, and I dare say our neighbours
have the same; and yet old wheat sold at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
bushel last week; and some new wheat for 8<i>s.</i> I
hope, though I am a farmer, that the prices will
soon fall, for the poor labourers cannot earn a subsistence
for their families when bread bears such a
price. I have about forty reapers at work, at present,
to take advantage of the fine weather. I brewed
seven hogsheads of small beer for them, and fear it
will not last till the end of harvest. The poor
reapers and haymakers bring nothing but water
into the field, which, with bad cheese and fine bread,
is their general fare. I think our northern people
are much more notable. Their meals are more
plentiful and less delicate. They eat coarse bread,
and drink a great deal of milk, and have often salt beef.</p>

<p>“... I must not congratulate you on the taking
of Ticonderoga, as I imagine all the prophecies in
your House foretold it would not be taken; and I
observe, in general, if people have predicted a misfortune,
they had rather it should happen than have
their prediction fall into discredit.”</p>

<p>London life began to try her strength. In a note
to Garrick, at the close of the year: “I’m hurried to
death with assemblies,” is the form of her excuse for
not calling on Mrs. Garrick; “and I am forced to
manage <i>mon souffle de vie</i>.” She hardly dares hope
to secure Lord Lyttelton’s company to meet Garrick,
unless on a Saturday or Sunday; “for the peers are
as inactive as Jews on Saturday, and as jolly as the
idlest Christians on Sunday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>The shadow of the loved brother Morris falls on
the following letter:</p>

<p>“<i>January 8, 1778.</i> ... My spirits felt a great
damp at first returning to London, where I used to
enjoy the friendly converse of my poor departed
brother. Death, disasters, and incidents have reduced
a large fireside to a small circle. A few years,
indeed, shows me that the flattering hopes one entertained
in the nursery, of living and social gaiety and
freedom with those nearly allied in blood, were mere
pleasing delusions. If other things do not sever
these natural connections, the fatal scissors cuts
their thread.</p>

<p>“Tho’ my poor brother never had opportunity of
amassing great wealth, I was in hopes he would
have left some thousands more behind him; but
the easiness and flexibility of his temper, and a
certain placid indolence, made him give into more
expense than was prudent. The world lays the
whole blame on him, and is loud in compassionate
lamentations for his widow. Indeed, her present condition
is very lamentable, and I pity her extremely;
but certainly she loved expense better than he did.
I imagine, poor man, he thought her fine dress and
appearance raised her in the eyes of the world.
There is no end of the bad consequences of an
improper marriage. When men and women make
an indiscreet match, they say it is no concern of
any one; but when any distress is the consequence,
the friends who were thought impertinent if they
troubled themselves about the match, are thought
cruel if they take no part of the evil.</p>

<p>“... M. de Jarnac, who married an Irish beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
in the mistaken opinion that she was also a fortune,
has been stock-jobbing here prodigiously; but if we
should really have a French war, he will be bit.</p>

<p>“A very superb theatre is going to be built in the
Haymarket. It is to be in prices the same as the
opera; no places taken, and the play to begin at
eight o’clock, which certainly suits better the present
hour of dining. Once a week, each of the
other theatres, on certain conditions, are to lend
their actors; so they will each save the expence
of a sixth part at least of their theatrical shows.
The other five nights their houses will be the fuller.
If ye London apprentices of these days are half as
bold as he who kill’d the lion, I think they will
assault our new theatre. Neither its price, hours,
nor situation will suit them. The town has been
very sickly. Lady George Germaine has been dangerously
ill of the measles, but is better.</p>

<p>“... Montagu” (her nephew and heir) “is in fine
health; and as to spirits, he never wants them. He
rides in the manège from eleven till twelve, and
then his tutor sets him on Pegasus. The day before
yesterday was the first time he had attain’d the
honour of riding between the pillars, and he was
as proud of it as Alexander when he had tamed
Bucephalus. He dances, under the care of the
celebrated M. Valonys, early every morning. These
exercises make a boy more healthy as well as more
graceful. On Tuesday he returns to Harrow, where
his master tells me he does very well. I carried
him to-day to see Mr. Lever’s museum. The collection
of birds, both as to their variety and preservation,
exceed that in the King of France’s collection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
of natural curiosities; but, not being shown me by
M. de Buffons and Monsr. D’Aubenton, I did not
see them with so much pleasure. The finest as
well as rarest bird being a wise and learned man.
Mr. Lever is gone into the country, and I was disappointed
at not seeing a man who would sell in exchange
an acre of good land for an extraordinary
fungus.”</p>

<p><i>Hill Street, February 21, 1778.</i>—“... The town
is now full of company; full of bustle. Real business
and serious occupation have their hours of
retreat and rest, but the pursuits of pleasure have no
intermissions. The change of objects is the <i>delassement</i>
in that case. As to me, I am, like other light
and insignificant matters, whisked about in the
whirlwind.</p>

<p>“I approve my dear neice’s ambition to excel in
dancing a minouet; not that dancing a minouet is a
matter of great importance; but a desire to do
everything well will carry her on to perfections of
a higher kind.... A little ball, a frolick now and
then, is very good for young persons, but I think
you and my brother judged very well in not carrying
my neice to assemblies. In our silly, dissipated
town, girls never are produced into assemblies till
after seventeen, and, indeed, they would never have
anything but absurdity and affectation, if they were
introduced into the world in their infancy.</p>

<p>“... I am glad my father has agreed to allow
Mrs. (Morris) Robinson an hundred pounds a year,
to which I have added fifty. She now knows that
she will have a subsistence, and must accommodate
herself to it. So far it is comfortable to her, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
I am sure it is happy for the family that the world
should not have a reason to be talking about it. Mr.
Danne, Mr. Wilmot, and several persons of credit in
the law and in other professions, came to me with
strong remonstrances at the cruelty of letting Mr.
Morris Robinson’s widow be destitute. So that, for
the honour of the family, I would have given her
what she now has, if my father had refused it. I
have had only a thousand pounds out of my family,
and for Mrs. (Morris) Robinson I have no partiality;
but in Italy you have heard the most powerful of all
arguments to do right, it is the address of beggars,
their ‘<i>Fate ben per voi!</i>’ To be justifying bad
things by others’ faults is never graceful; but in
family connections there is great folly in it, and it is
only giving people occasion to throw disgrace when
it comes too near one.</p>

<p>“It has been a great mortification that Mrs.
(Morris) Robinson’s name has been often mentioned
at this end of the town lately. I was always desirous
that it might remain on the other side Temple
Bar; but my brother was so generally beloved, that,
out of respect to him, his widow was an object of
compassion.”</p>

<p>The subject is pursued in the next letter to Mrs.
William Robinson.</p>

<p>“<i>February 28, 1778.</i> ... I am sure you who have
a feeling and a generous heart will be pleased with
Mr. Thomas Harris and Mrs. Harris’s behaviour to
Mrs. M. Robinson. Besides paying her all kinds of
civilities, Mr. Harris desired that when she went to
a new habitation, he might present her with a hundred
pounds towards furnishing it. Bad as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
world is, and tho’ selfishness makes so great a part
of the human composition, yet a social, kind character
like my poor brother’s makes its impression
on tempers of the like kind, and, indeed, one has a
comfort in seeing his memory so much beloved and
respected. Mrs. M. Robinson has continually some
marks of attention paid to her. As hard hearts love
to insult adversity, tender ones endeavour to console
it. The civilities the poor woman receives are paid,
not to her merits, but to her distress or my brother’s
memory. In either case, they do honour to human
nature.”</p>

<p>An incident that might have cost Mrs. Scott her
life, from her cap having caught fire, is cheerfully
noticed in a letter, dated Saturday, March 1, 1778,
from Mrs. Scott to Mrs. Robinson: “I am burned
pretty deep in the back of my neck.... From
thence to my face, I have reason to hope, will be
more speedy of cure, and the little damage my face
received is well already, except an abridgment of
eyebrow and eyelash, which, perhaps, may never
come again, and I am perfectly indifferent whether
they do or no; for at fifty-five (at least), half an
eyebrow is just as good as a whole one. I have
reason to think myself most happy in having come
off so well as I did, considering all the very horrid
circumstances of the affair....”</p>

<p>Of one of her nephews, she significantly adds: “I
think how much better a good dull man is than a
Charles Fox and many others, whose talents and
vices have grown together in a superlative degree.”
And in a subsequent letter she treats of her young
niece and what young nieces love:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p><i>May 7, 1778.</i> Mrs. Scott to Mrs. Robinson.—“I
had the pleasure of seeing your daughter on
Monday look very well, and dance a good minuet....
Her mantua-maker is certainly the most insatiable
of that insatiable tribe. She requires two
yards more of lutestring, tho’ she has already had
twenty-three, which is most shameful; and her art
gives her no right to be so, for it is not well made;
at least, the sleeves set abominably.... The ball
was resplendent—was full, and the children’s dresses
extremely expensive, and very pretty and whimsical;
but I could not forbear being sorry to see so much
extravagance used, to breed girls as early as possible
to the love of it, as if it would not come quite soon
enough: though my niece’s dress was not chargeable
with that fault: being white, it looked very nice and
genteel, and became her....</p>

<p>“It is reported that Lord Percy’s haste for a
divorce is increased by his having fallen violently
in love with Miss Burrell. It is so like a story to
be made that the truth appears to me doubtful.” ...</p>

<p>The same writer subsequently touches on a variety
of subjects: “Mrs. (Morris) Robinson tells me she
finds a good dinner more necessary than ever; ...
and as she is determined to live in London, tho’ she
should be able to afford but one room, yet she has
friends who will often invite her to a good house and
a good dinner.</p>

<p>“... Her resentment appears to me very unreasonable,
but her anger was always more ready at call
than her reason, and, by her present distresses, seems
to have gained superior strength. Had the late
misfortunes softened her temper into mildness, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
might justly have said, ‘It is good for me that I have
been afflicted!’”</p>

<p>In speaking of a tutor recommended for young
Morris Robinson, Mrs. Scott writes: “At Mrs.
Cockerell’s he taught the young ladies to read,
had a few pupils of his own, and read and preached
well as curate in Chelsea Church.... The only
blot in Mr. Sympson’s character is that he was,
I presume, two or three years married before
he acknowledged it, in order to keep his fellowship;
for when he brought his wife to Chelsea,
she had a child or two. Though necessity ought
not to be without law (we are told it is so), it
may justly be pleaded as some alleviation of the
breach of law. As his wife, on this account, came
among us under a little cloud, the quality of Chelsea
did not visit her, except Mrs. Freind, and one or two
more who spoke well of her.... The other Miss
Burrell (one, you know, married Lord Algernon
Percy) is going to be married to Duke Hamilton,
and they are going to consummate their unfinished
loves on shipboard; for she is to accompany him to
America, where it is very proper he should go, as
the amplest field for him to indulge his passion for
shooting. He has exercised himself with shooting
across Hanover Square out of a wind-gun, to the
utter dismay of old Lady Westmoreland, and Sir
Thomas Fredericks. A bullet whistled by the ear
of the latter, as he sat in his dining-room, and lodged
in the wainscot; two more penetrated into other
parts. Surprized at so dangerous an incident, he ran
to the window, and there saw the duke, his <i>vis à vis</i>,
at his window, with a gun in his hand. He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
sallied forth to give his grace a deserved chiding,
but during the time, the duke having had leisure
to charge again, he shot dead a favourite dog which
bore Sir Thomas company.”</p>

<p>In a later letter, Mrs. Montagu, referring to the
above marriage, says: “Miss Burrell has no reason
to be afraid of Duke Hamilton. He might boyishly
fire off a gun, but he has the character of a very
good-humoured young man. He has no vices, is
handsome, and is, in all respects, like other people.
He does not make any great <i>éclat</i>; but the next best
thing to great and good reputation is, to be little
spoken of. When there are not talents for the first,
there is prudence in the latter.</p>

<p>“... I suppose you know there was a report of
my father’s death. My porter had a very fatiguing
morning with messages. I had promised to introduce
the Dowager Duchess of Beaufort to the French ambassadress
on Wednesday night. So, tho’ the weather
was terrible, I went out, and such was the report of
poor papa, that I was stared at as a ghost as I enter’d
the room, and the servants below were very busy
questioning my footmen. To-day I had a message
from Lady Anne and Lady Betty Finch, with an
apology, that not having heard of that melancholy
event till to-day, they had not sent their enquiries.
All this while the old gentleman is in as good health
as he has been this twelvemonth.”</p>

<p>This purely private subject is followed, in a letter
of April 10, 1778, by one of public importance.</p>

<p>“... I am sure you will be desirous to hear a
true account of Lord Chatham’s accident in ye House,
and of his present condition of health. The newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
are in but little credit in general, but their
account of that affair has been very exact. His lordship
had been long confined by a fit of the gout, so
was debilitated by illness and want of exercise. The
House was invaded by numbers who went to hear
him on so critical a state of affairs. The thunder of
his eloquence was abated, and the lightning of his
eyes was dimmed in a certain degree, when he rose
to speak; but the glory of his former administration
threw a mellow lustre around him, and his experience
of publick affairs gave the force of an oracle to what
he said, and a reverential silence reigned through the
senate. He spoke in answer to the Duke of Richmond.
The Duke of Richmond replied. Then his
lordship rose up to speak again. The genius and
spirit of Britain seemed to heave in his bosom, and
he sank down speechless. He continued half an hour
in a fit. His eldest and second sons and Lord Mahon
were in great agony, waiting the doubtful event. At
last, he happily recovered; and though he is very
weak still, I am assured by his family, that he looks
better than he did before this accident. The next
day, Lord Shelburne and the Duke of Richmond
carried on the same debate, and Lord Shelburne’s
speech was much admired.</p>

<p>“... It is said my friend, Mr. Pulteney, has been
twice at Paris, negotiating with Doctor Franklin;
but the result is not known. Mrs. Pulteney was
here last night, but I was too discreet even to mention
the affair.</p>

<p>“... Montagu came home to-day. The school
in a manner broke up yesterday, but as the weather
is hot, the town sickly, and I was to have an assembly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
I would not bring him home. He goes to
Sandleford on Tuesday, and I am to follow him on
Wednesday. The weather is inviting, and I hate
this season of the year in London. If I am here, I
am obliged often to have company, and my eating-room
is not large enough nor high enough for large
dinners and numerous guests.</p>

<p>“... Doctor Robinson, who call’d on me this
morning, told me, a gentleman he met in Berkely
Square just before, assured him the French had taken
two of our armed ships. The doctor is an historian
of great veracity, but in an affair of this kind, he
could not examine the evidence.</p>

<p>“... Lord Kerry’s fine furniture sold very dear
these bad times. I bought a large glass at the French
ambassador’s sale, and some other things for
my new house, pretty cheap. I suppose so
great a sale just before made the second sale more
reasonable.”</p>

<p><i>October 10, 1778.</i> Mrs. Scott to Mrs. W. Robinson.—“...
He” (Rev. Wm. Robinson, who had
published a political pamphlet,) “has won the heart
of the wax-worker, Mrs. Wright. Mr. Roweller went
to see her performances, and, in conversation, asked
her if she had seen the pamphlet. She told him she
was charmed with it, had sent over a great number
into her country, and assured him the author would
be adored there; and desired, if he knew him, that
he would tell him, that if he liked her or either
of her daughters, they were entirely at his service.
One of the girls cried out, ‘Lord, mamma,
we never saw the gentleman. We may not like
him!’ ‘I don’t care a farthing for that,’ replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Mrs. Wright; ‘if he likes you, you shall marry
him!’”</p>

<p>Ladies of another quality come upon the stage in
the following chapter.</p>

</div>

<p><i>December 20, 1778.</i> Mrs. Scott to Mrs. Robinson,
Denton.—“... Miss Coke is a most extraordinary
character, and, in my opinion, a most contemptible
one, though I suppose she thinks herself a heroine.
I have great compassion on one who blushes at her
frailties, or rather her vices, for I hate those mincing
names, designed only to palliate wrong actions; but
I detest a woman who glories in her shame, and sets
the world at defiance. Such desperate spirits should
not be clad in feminine bodies. They are fit only for
Sixteen-string Jack and his brother ruffians. Your
daughter may in due time fall in love; nay, tho’ not
very probable, she may even fall, in a stronger sense
of the word; ... but I will venture to answer for
her never being one of those intrepid damsels who
brazen out their vices, and, without any change of
countenance, raise blushes on the cheeks of all their
sex. If she ever does ill, she will do it sneakingly;
will feel the censure of others, and, suffering for her
own, will rectify her errors. However, I am apt to
believe she will escape clear of any of this nature.</p>

<p>“... The new singer at the Pantheon is said to
be the most extraordinary that ever was heard; unlike
every one that ever sang before; very much like a
bird, and the compass of her voice far above whatever
was known. She has one hundred guineas a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
night. When, in infancy, she was taken out of
a ditch, after a boar or a hog had devoured one
fesse,—<i>car elle est aussi mal partagée que la suivante
de la Princesse Cunegonda</i>,—who would have
imagined she could ever be so great a lady? All her
charms are centred in her voice; for she is exceedingly
ugly.”</p>

<p><i>December 31, 1778.</i> Mrs. S. to Mrs. R.—“On
my brother (William) Robinson’s return from Burfield,
he will be in better spirits, as a light heart and a thin
pair of breeches is a conjunction he has little notion
of. I fancy when he feels the gain of godliness in
his pocket, he will be mighty alert and joyous, and
have a better idea of a merry Christmas than he has
ever yet formed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s letters now succeed.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Robinson. “<i>Tunbridge Wells, 1778.</i> ...
I love London extremely, where one has the
choice of society, but I hate ye higgledy-piggledy of
the watering-places. One never sees an owl in a
flock of wild geese, nor a pigeon in the same company
as hawks and kites. I leave it to the naturalists
to determine on ye merit of each species of fowl.
All I assert is, that nature has designed birds of
a feather should flock together. On the menagerie
of the Pantiles there is not so just an assortment.
However, I have been fortunate now in finding Lady
Spencer, Lady Clermont, Mrs. Boughton, Mr. and
Mrs. Wedderburne, and many of my voluntary London
society here. There was a pretty good ball last
Tuesday; and Lady Spencer and the Duchess of
Devonshire were so good as to chaperone Miss Gregory;
so I did not think it necessary for me to sit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
and see the graces of Messrs. L’Epy Valhouys and
Mlle. Heinel exhibited by the misses. I understand
there are not above three dancing-men, and the
master of the ceremonies makes one of this number.</p>

<p>“Minouet dancing is just now out of fashion; and
by the military air and dress of many of the ladies,
I should not be surprised if backsword and cudgell
playing should take place of it. I think our encampment
excellent for making men less effeminate; but
if they make our women more masculine, the male
and female character, which should ever be kept
distinct, will now be more so than they have been.</p>

<p>“... We still have fine weather here, and I agree
with you, that the dust and other little inconveniences
that attend a dry season are not to be put in any
account. I would have months of dust for one fine
day.</p>

<p>“... I have not said anything yet to you of my
poor father. The subject is a very melancholy one.
At present, all one can hope for him is an easy exit.
The great decay of his mental powers has for some
time rendered him an object of great pity; yet, to
my unspeakable indignation, I was told by a gentleman
here, that one of ye whist-party at the coffee-house,
some months ago, had not only refus’d to pay
a debt of eighteen guineas, which he owed my father,
but had triumphed over him in a shocking manner,
asserting his loss of memory and imbecillity. What
a wretch must it be that would insult an old man.
Extream old age is little to be coveted. In a long
life one must outlive one’s friends, and, perhaps, oneself.
I imagine by the accounts of to-day, that the
great deliverer from human woes has before this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
time given him his release. My porter calls every
night, just before the last letter bell, to let me know
how he does....</p>

<p>“It is much the fashion here to go and see the
camp at Coxheath.... My father’s illness would
make it impossible for me to go; and I had much
rather have the honour of seeing their majesties at
St. James’s. Of all fields, the field of Mars is that
I like least. The fields which sustain manhood are
pleasant objects; those in which they are destroyed,
suggest melancholly ideas.</p>

<p>“The fine condition in which I found my estates
in Northumberland and in Yorkshire, and the universal
prosperity there, made me wish we might enjoy
our plenty in peace, run no new hazards, and incur
no new taxes. The labouring people in the north do
not suffer the poverty we see in the same rank in the
south, and our parish rates are very low.</p>

<p>“... Lord Kames and Mrs. Drummond, his wife,
came from Edinburgh, which is an hundred miles
from Denton, on purpose to spend a few days with
me. His lordship is a prodigy. At eighty-three he
is as gay and as nimble as he was at twenty-five.
His sight, hearing, and memory perfect. He has
a great deal of knowledge and a lively imagination,
and is a most entertaining companion. I have
promised to return his visit two years hence. I
think as he has not grown old in the space of eighty-three
years, two years more cannot have much effect.
If it should abate a little of his vivacity, he would
still have enough left.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sandleford, February 10, 1779.</i> ... I am inform’d
that our minister at Lisbon sends an account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
that Admiral Rodney fell in with the Spanish fleet
in the Gulf of Gibraltar, has blown up the admiral’s
ship of ninety guns, taken four or five ships, and
only one has got into Cadiz. This news is but just
arrived. Rule, Brittannia, rule the waves. There is
an admirable work of Mr. Anstey’s just published
called ‘Speculation; or, a Defence of Manhood,’
a poem.</p>

<p>“... Montagu is still at Harrow.... His master
says more of him than it becomes me to repeat; so
I will, for once in my life, show more discretion than
vanity.”</p>

<p>To Mrs. Robinson. “<i>Sandleford, June ye 13th,
1779.</i> ... As I had not been to Bath since the
Circus was finished and the Crescent began, I was
much struck with the beauty of the town. In point
of society and amusement, it comes next (but after a
long interval) to London. There are many people
established at Bath who were once of the polite and
busy world, so they retain a certain politeness of
manner and vivacity of mind which one cannot find
in many country towns. All contracted societies,
where there are no great objects of pursuit, must in
time grow a little narrow and <i>un peu fade</i>; but then
there is an addition of company by people who come
to the waters, from all the active parts of life, and
they throw a vivacity into conversation which we
must not expect from persons whose chief object was
the odd trick or a <i>sans prendre</i>. Cards is the great
business of the inhabitants of Bath. The ladies, as is
usual in little societies, are some of them a little gossiping
and apt to find fault with the cap, the gown, the
manner, or the understandings of their neighbours.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
But that does not much concern the water-drinkers,
who, not being resident, are not the objects of their
envy; and, I must say, they are all very obliging to
strangers. As the primate of Ireland was at Bath
almost all the time I was there, I had the daily pleasure
of passing my time in the most agreable society;
for such is that of a person of his noble mind, endeared
still more by his friendship to our family.</p>

<p>“I did not go at all to the publick rooms, which
are hot and noisy. As much as I could, I excused
myself from private assemblies. So, when the primate,
Lord Stormont, and some others of my acquaintance
who happened to be at Bath, had an idle
hour, they bestowed it on me. The Bishop of Peterborough,
very unluckily for me, went away the day I
came to Bath. We just met at Marlbro’. Another
agreable acquaintance of mine, the Provost of Eton,
arrived only just before I came away. Mr. Anstey
was often with me, and you will believe he is very
droll and entertaining; but what recommends him
more, is his great attention to his family. He has
eight children. He instructs his boys in the Greek
and Latin, so that they are fitted for the upper forms
of Eton School, where their education is finished. He
has a house in the Crescent, at which he resides the
greatest part of the year. Mrs. Anstey is a very
sensible, amiable woman, and does not deal in the
gossip of the place. There is also Mr. Hamilton in
the Crescent. He is very polite, agreable, and has
been much abroad and lived much in the great world.</p>

<p>“I should dislike the Bath much less, if the houses
were larger. I always take the largest that can be
got in the Circus or Crescent. On the outside it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
appears a good stone edifice; in the inside, it is a nest
of boxes, in which I should be stifled, if the masonry
were not so bad as to admit winds at many places.
The society and mode of life are infinitely preferable
to what one can find in any other country town, but
much less agreable than London. I believe if I was
to act the part of Minos in this World, I should use it
as a kind of purgatory, to which I should send those
who had not the taste or qualifications which deserved
to be put into the capital city, nor were yet so disagreably
unsociable as to merit suffering the terrors
and horrors of a long winter in the country.”</p>

<p>The devotion of Bath visitors to cards has been
satirised in many an epigram, more or less pointed.
There were certain individuals among them who were
not likely to come under the eye of Mrs. Montagu,
but who did not escape the notice of Fielding. “I
have known a stranger at Bath,” he says, in the first
volume of “Amelia,” “who has happened fortunately
(I might almost say unfortunately) to have four by
honours in his hand almost every time he dealt for
a whole evening, shunned universally by the whole
company the next day!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Anstey, in a little excursion from home,
called here on his way to London, where he arrived
just to behold the horrors of the conflagration. On
his return back, he made me another visit, and his
countenance bore the impression of horror, from the
dreadful things he had beheld. He got back to Bath
just in time to be present at ye riots there.</p>

<p>“Tho’ I am not personally acquainted with the
family of Sir E. Knatchbull, I cannot help being glad
the heir of it has made so proper a match. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
heard a good character of the young lady. She has
a noble fortune, and, by her mother, must be allied to
the best families in Kent. Commerce has so enriched
this kingdom, that in every county there are some
new gentry who eclypse those ancient families which
once had the superiority, and I must own I love to
see it return to them. The mellow dignity of a gentleman
is infinitely preferable to the crude pride of
a nabob. I believe you are acquainted with Sir
Archer and Lady Croft. They are now come to live
in their house in this neighbourhood. It had been
lett to a mad West Indian, who ruined his fortune,
and then shot himself; after that, to a nabob. I never
visit the West Indians in my neighbourhood, because
they would teach my servants to drink rum; nor the
nabobs, lest they should teach them to want to eat
turtle and rich dainties. So I had not been at Dunstan
till the other day, since the old proprietor left it.</p>

<p>“I find the lower kind of neighbours are not
pleased with Sir A. and Lady Croft, because they
are not so profuse as the West, nor magnificent as
the East, Indian; but they seem to me very well-bred
people.</p>

<p>“My nephew Robinson, according to the primate’s
advice, is studying hard at Cambridge this vacation.
He has very good sense and an uncommon memory,
so he will reap great advantage from application to
study. The generality of young people in these days
spend all their time in travelling from place to place.
Such a life may fit them to be surveyors of highroads,
or, if very ingenious, to make maps of England,
but for nothing better. An uniformity of life
goes far in forming a consistency of character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“It would have done no harm to Montagu to have
practised lessons of idleness rather than study; from
the last, there is not anything to divert him here.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry I have not a frank in Denton.
However, that my double letter may not put your
pocket, as well as patience, to double expence, I
convey it to London in a frank, to save half the
charges.”</p>

<p>To Mrs. Robinson. “<i>Sandleford, August 18,
1779.</i>—Montagu’s master wrote me a letter on my
nephew’s leaving Harrow, giving him every praise
I could have wish’d, and desiring me to give him his
portrait to hang up with those of four of his distinguish’d
scholars who had left his school there. Those
young men have since had a considerable reputation
at the university, and I hope my young friend will
have the same. But one fears for youth in every new
stage it is to pass through. He was this summer
admitted of Trinity College. I should have preferr’d
St. John’s, as the discipline there is stricter; but his
tutor, Mr. Gilbank, being of Trinity, I could not
continue my nephew under his daily inspection if he
was not at the same college; and tho’ the salary
I give the tutor makes a considerable difference in
the expence, yet if parents are to be pardon’d who
spoil the child by sparing the rod, they are not so
who spoil the child to spare the guinea.”</p>

<p>Referring to the marriage of the daughter of her
brother Charles, she says: “... I imagine this week
my neice at Canterbury is made a happy bride, and
what is better, in the probability of being a happy
wife. Mr. Hougham has a very good character, and
I believe my neice is very amiable. Discretion and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
good-humour are the great sources of domestick happiness....
I dare say my dear neice (Mary) adorned
the ball at Canterbury with a charming minouet. I
believe the present Miss Robinsons excell by far in
that respect the former Miss Robinsons. And
I heartily wish all the steps they take in life may be
with more smoothness and more graces.</p>

<p>“I am impatient to have my new house fit for
habitation, as I think the large and high rooms and
its airy situation will be of great service to my
health; and I am sure such noble apartments will
be a great addition to my pleasures. In the winter
of the year and the winter of our life, our principal
enjoyments must be in our own house.... I suppose
I shall be advised to take some Bath waters
before the winter sets in.... I will get the better
of my passion for my new house, which is almost
equal to that of a lover to a mistress whom he thinks
very handsome and very good, and such as will make
him enjoy the dignity of life with ease, yet I will give
as much of the autumn as I shall be advis’d to the
Bath waters.... I have found much more benefit
from Bath waters than I have from Tunbridge for
some years past; and the accommodations at Bath
are infinitely preferable. There are not above two
houses on Mount Ephraim and Mount Pleasant that
are not mere hovels; the bedchambers are so low
and small that one is stifled; and, if the weather is
bad, one is confin’d all day in a little parlour not
much larger than a bird-cage; so that unless one
goes to Tunbridge at the beginning of the season,
one is miserably accommodated.</p>

<p>“The airings round Bath are delightful. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
every window of my house in the Crescent I had the
most beautiful prospects imaginable; so that I enjoyed
the sweet face of the fair month of May in all
her blooming charms.</p>

<p>“... I am very far from laughing at you, as you
suppose, for indulging reveries about your son’s
marrying. I often allow my fancy to dance at
Montagu’s wedding; and the times are such I can
hardly restrain it from attending his divorce bill
through the Houses of Lords and Commons. However,
it is better to suppose the times will mend. We
do more wisely, when we sweeten present cares with
the prospect of future pleasures, than when we embitter
present pleasures with future apprehensions.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Montagu made the last reflection,
she probably had in her mind the lines in her
favourite “Comus:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“... Be not over exquisite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For grant they be so, while they rest unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why need a man forestall his date of grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And run to meet what he would most avoid?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“... I have two objects in a daily state of
improvement—my nephew Montagu and my new
house. Many people would say my pleasure in both
will be less when they are arriv’d at their state of
perfection, but I am not of that opinion. The
pleasures of expectation and of possession are different,
but the quiet serenity of the latter is, methinks,
the best.”</p>

<p>To Mrs. Robinson. “<i>December ye 29th, 1779.</i> ...
Our town amours present us with every thing that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
horrible. Women without religion or virtue, and
men void even of a sense of honour. Never till now
did one hear of three divorces going forward in one
session, in which the ladies of the most illustrious
rank and families in Great Britain were concern’d.
Lady Percy was the wife of a nobleman of a most
distinguished merit, who had a mind too noble to be
satisfied with the greatest hereditary wealth and honours,
has, merely to serve his king and country,
exposed himself to all the difficulties and dangers of
military service. Lord Carmarthen is the prettiest
man in his person; the most polite and pleasing in
his manners, with a sweet temper and an excellent
Understanding, happily cultivated. As to Lord
Derby, to be sure, he has nothing on his side but the
seventh commandment; but that should be sufficient,
and was sufficient, in former times. Her family, it is
said, triumph that this divorce is only an ugly step
to an elevation of title. However, the name of an
adulteress will surely blot whatever shall be written
over it, even were it an imperial title. It is said,
however, that Lord D. will be only divorced in the
Spiritual Court; and, in that case, he will have the
revenge of keeping her in her present awkward situation;
but while he is punishing the faithless Wife,
he is doing the greatest service to her gallant (the
Duke of Dorset), whom he prevents from incurring
infamy and also getting a most extravagant wife.</p>

<p>“I approve much of your getting a dance once
a week for the young folks, and I am particularly
glad my nephew is of the party. Grace of person is
more important for a woman than a man; but the
capacity of dancing a minouet is more serviceable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
a young man, for, by so doing, he obliges many young
ladies, while the minouet miss seldom pleases any
girl but herself. Unless a girl is very beautiful, very
well-shaped, and very genteel, she gives little pleasure
to the spectators of her minouet; and, indeed,
so unpolite are the setters-by in all assemblies, that
they express a most ungrateful joy when the minouets
are over. For my part, tho’ I feel as great ennui as
my neighbours on those occasions, I never allow myself
to appear so; for I look upon a minouet to be
generally an act of filial piety, which gives real pleasure
to fathers, mothers, and aunts.... In France,
good minouets are clapped; but I believe no nation
arrived at such a degree of civilization as to encore
them.</p>

<p>“... I do not know whether I am more stupid
than other people, but I neither find any of the vexation
some find in building, nor the great amusement
others tell me they experience in it. Indeed, if it
were not that a house must be building before it can
be built, I should never have been a builder.... I
have not had a quarter of an hour’s pain or pleasure
from the operation. I have not met with the least disappointment
or mortification. It has gone on as fast
and well as I expected, and, when it is habitable, I
shall take great pleasure in it; for it is an excellent
house, finely situated, and just such as I have always
wish’d, but never hoped, to have.</p>

<p>“... I know that in some little alterations we
made at Sandleford, the country workmen were so
tedious, we were obliged to send for carpenters from
London; but here we have such a plenty of Hands,
that everything goes continually on.</p>

<p>“... I was grieved to see Scott’s Hall advertised
to be sold. It is a pity such an ancient family
should be rooted up to plant some upstart nabob in
its place.</p>

<p>“... I suppose your consort was concerned at
the indiscretion of his Pallas, Mrs. Macaulay. Had
she married a great-great-grandson of one of the
regicides, however youthful he had been, it might
have been pardonable; but the second mate of a
surgeon to an Indian man-of-war, of twenty-two,
seems no way accountable. If ye Minerva she carried
on the outside of her coach had been consulted,
no doubt but the sage goddess, even in effigy, would
have given signs of disapprobation. I have sent you
some verses of Mr. Anstey’s on the subject. The
first copy he put into the urn, at Mrs. Millar’s, at
Batheaston; and being desired, when he drew them,
to read them a second time, instead of so doing, he
read the other copy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bath, November ye 21, 1780.</i> ... It was time for
Montagu to go to Cambridge, where I had rather he
had lectures and took degrees under <i>alma mater</i> than
under the goddess of folly and dissipation here. In
these water-drinking places, every one is more idle
and more silly than at their respective homes, where
all have some business, and many most important
pursuits. I consider, really, life here as a mere dream.
Some walk very gracefully, and talk very agreably in
their sleep; but a young man should not begin life
by acting Le Sonambule. It is very well to do so
between the acts of a busy drama, or, alas! as a
farce, when the chief catastrophe is over, and the
curtain is dropped between the busy world and us....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
The primate of Ireland is here. He very kindly
sent to my nephew Morris to come to him. Under
such protection, I think Bath as good a place as
any he can be in. The advantage of domestick society
with the primate is the greatest imaginable;
nor could any parent behave with more real kindness
to the young man, whose gratitude and deference to
his grace make the best return that can be to such
goodness.... My Nephew very wisely and laudably
pursued, with the greatest application, the course of
classical studies the primate wish’d him to fall into;
and it is with great satisfaction I hear his grace speak
of what he has done, with the highest approbation.</p>

<p>“... My new house is almost ready.... I propose
to move all my furniture from Hill Street thither,
and to let my house unfurnished till a good purchaser
offers. Then, should I get a bad tenant, I can seize
his goods for rent; and such security becomes necessary
in these extravagant times.</p>

<p>“... Doctor Moisey being dead, I applied to Doctor
de la Cour, your friend, when I had my cold, to know
if I might drink the waters. The poor doctor is
very sickly, and, perhaps, from that reason, he is the
most inattentive physician I ever knew or heard of.
He is very agreable in conversation, but does not remember
for a whole day what he has ordered. He
suits me very well at present; for I want no medical
help, and I always love a lively companion. He took
three guineas of me, for which I had some saline
draughts and a long direction as to food, the quantity
of water to be taken.... The saline draughts
were very good and the food was very wholesome;
but as I knew before that those draughts were good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
for a cold, and mutton and chicken easy of digestion,
I rather regret my three guineas. But this is between
ourselves; for I never say what may hurt a man in
his profession; so that, when others complain of a
loss of memory and inattention, I am silent.”</p>

<p>The period has now arrived in which some notice
is required of the Bluestockings, of the date of
whose origin Boswell has made an erroneous statement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
THE BLUESTOCKINGS</h2>

</div>

<p>To Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Vesey (a warm-hearted
Irish lady), and Mrs. Ord (daughter of an eminent
surgeon, named Dillingham, and subsequently a
wealthy widow) is generally ascribed the merit of
having founded parties where conversation should
form the chief, if not only, occupation. But there
was a lady much connected with the above, and, indeed,
with all the Blues, to whom may be assigned
the honour of first attacking what it was the object
of the Bluestockings to overthrow, namely, Miss
Mulso, better known to us as Mrs. Chapone,—a
name which she acquired by marriage in 1760. When
this lady was about twenty-three (1750), she, in concert
with Johnson, wrote the tenth number of the
<i>Rambler</i>. Under the character of Lady Racket,
she sent compliments to that censor of manners, and
“lets him know she will have cards at her house
every Sunday, ... where he will be sure of meeting
all the good company in town.... She longs to see
the torch of truth produced at an assembly, and to
admire the charming lustre it will throw on the jewels,
complexions, and behaviour of every dear creature
there.”</p>

<p>Of course, this note was written as a text to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Johnson might append a comment that should sharply
censure that card-playing against which intellectual
ladies were beginning to set their faces and close
their doors. Accordingly, the <i>Rambler</i> remarks: “At
card-tables, however brilliant, I have always thought
my visit lost; for I could know nothing of the company
but their clothes and their faces. I saw their
looks clouded at the beginning of every game, with
a uniform solicitude now and then in its progress,
varied with a short triumph, at one time wrinkled
with cunning; at another, deadened with despondency,
or, by accident, flushed with rage at the unskilful or
unlucky play of a partner. From such assemblies
... I was quickly forced to retire; they were too
trifling for me when I was grave, and too dull when
I was cheerful.” When Johnson suggests to Lady
Racket to “light up her apartments with myrtle,”
he seems to have made the suggestion which ladies
of sense and means adopted, and for which they
were ridiculed and nicknamed by persons as brainless
as any of the figures staring stupidly at nothing
on the court cards.</p>

<p>There already existed, however, conversation parties
that were as little attractive to persons of good
taste as the ruinous card-tables were to persons of
prudence. In one of the few letters of Mrs. Scott
which survived her unfortunate request that all
should be destroyed, she thus wrote of card-parties
and <i>conversations</i> in the very year, 1750, that
Johnson and Miss Mulso combined in the <i>Rambler</i>
to reform both:</p>

<p>“I find no objection to large companies, except
the want of society in them.... I have not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
natural requisite for society—the love of cards....
I excuse myself from card-parties by saying I have a
great dislike to sitting by a card-table, which no one
can pretend is unreasonable; and I find nothing is so
useful as asserting one’s liberty in these ceremonious
points: it gives little offence, and without it, one may
remain all one’s life the suffering slave of a painful
civility.... I am glad, by-the-bye, there are such
things as cards in the world; for otherwise one would
be teazed by eternal conversation parties, which are
terrible things. I seldom venture into a Sunday-night
circle, and I quite disclaimed them a year before
I left London. The principal speakers are
always those to whom one is the least inclined to
attend. Every day in the week would be as much
taken up with these parties, if cards did not conquer
even the love of talking.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, a year before she acquired that
name, had expressed her distaste for the flashy conversation
of her time. In a letter to her sister Sarah,
she describes one of the “talkers” with great vivacity.
“Mr. B——’s wife put out her strength to be
witty, and, in short, showed such a brilliant genius,
that I turned about and asked who it was that was so
willing to be ingenious; for she had endeavoured to
go off two or three times, but had unhappily flashed
in the pan.” In 1750, Mrs. Montagu and some other
ladies attempted to reform manners, by having parties
where cards could not be thought of, and where the
mental power was freshest for conversation.</p>

<p>In that year, 1750, there was a charming French
lady taking notes amongst us. Madame du Bocage,
in her “Letters on England, Holland, and Italy,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
notices Mrs. Montagu; and from the notice may be
learned, that the last-named lady was already giving
entertainments of a nature to benefit society. While
at the Duke of Richmond’s, as many as eighteen
card-tables were “set for playing” in the gallery of
his house near Whitehall, with supper and wine to
follow, for the consolation of the half-ruined, and congratulation
of the lucky, gamblers, Mrs. Montagu gave
breakfasts. Madame du Bocage thus speaks of them
and of the hostess:</p>

<p>“In the morning, breakfasts, which enchant as
much by the exquisite viands as by the richness of
the plate on which they are served up, agreably
bring together the people of the country and strangers.
We breakfasted in this manner to-day, April 8,
1750, at Lady Montagu’s” (as Madame du Bocage
mistakenly calls her), “in a closet lined with painted
paper of Pekin, and furnished with the choicest movables
of China. A long table, covered with the finest
linen, presented to the view a thousand glittering
cups, which contained coffee, chocolate, biscuits,
cream, butter, toasts, and exquisite tea. You must
understand that there is no good tea to be had anywhere
but in London. The mistress of the house,
who deserves to be served at the table of the gods,
poured it out herself. This is the custom, and, in
order to conform to it, the dress of the English ladies,
which suits exactly to their stature, the white apron
and the pretty straw hat, become them with the
greatest propriety, not only in their own apartments,
but at noon, in St. James’s Park, where they walk
with the stately and majestic gait of nymphs.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was not the only lady who gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
those literary breakfasts. Lady Schaub (a foreign
lady who would marry Sir Luke) received company
at those pleasant repasts. Madame du Bocage met
Frederick Prince of Wales at one of them. The
prince, who, with all his faults, was an accomplished
gentleman, came incognito, so as to enjoy and to
allow greater freedom. Madame du Bocage treated
him as an ordinary gentleman, and was perfectly delighted
with his conversation, as well as with his
thorough knowledge of the literature of her own
country. They gossiped beneath the Sigismunda
(one of many fine pictures possessed by Sir Luke),
which stirred Hogarth to paint the same subject, in
rivalry, as he thought, with Corregio; but the picture
was since discovered to be by Farini.</p>

<p>When the breakfasts gave way to the evening
coteries for conversation (with orgeat, lemonades, tea,
and biscuits) is not known. After these had lasted a
few years, the word “Bluestocking” occurs for the
first time in Mrs. Montagu’s letters. Writing, in
March, 1757, to Dr. Monsey, she says: “Our friend,
Mr. Stillingfleet, is more attached to the lilies of the
field than to the lilies of the town, who toil and spin
as little as the others, and, like the former, are better
arrayed than Solomon in all his glory. I assure you,
our philosopher is so much a man of pleasure, he has
left off his old friends and his blue stockings, and is
at operas and other gay assemblies every night; so
imagine whether a sage doctor, a dropsical patient,
and a bleak mountain are likely to attract him.” Mr.
Benjamin Stillingfleet used to be seen as often at
Mrs. Vesey’s gatherings as at Mrs. Montagu’s.
“Bluestocking” was not a term exclusively applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
to Mrs. Montagu’s assemblies. To all assemblies
where ladies presided and scholars were welcomed,
the name seems to have been given. A “Bluestocking
club” never existed. The title was given in derision
by persons who, as before said, lacked the
brains, or who were not distinguished by other merits
that would have entitled them to an invitation. The
assemblies of Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Vesey, and Mrs.
Ord were spoken of indifferently as <i>bas-bleu</i> assemblies.</p>

<p>Sir William Forbes, in his “Life of Beattie,” states
that the society of eminent friends who met at Mrs.
Montagu’s originally consisted of Mrs. Montagu,
Mrs. Vesey, Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Carter, Lord
Lyttelton, the Earl of Bath (Pulteney), Horace Walpole,
and Mr. Stillingfleet. Around these some of
the most distinguished persons of intellect used to
assemble. Mrs. Vesey (daughter of the Bishop of
Ossory and wife of Agmondesham Vesey), says Sir
William, was another centre of pleasing and rational
society. Without attempting to shine herself, she
had the happy secret of bringing forward talents of
every kind, and for diffusing over the society the
gentleness of her own character. Mrs. Boscawen
(née Granville, wife of the renowned admiral), unknown
to the literary world, but made familiar to
modern readers by her pleasant letters in the Delany
correspondence, made herself welcome by “the
strength of her understanding, the poignancy of her
humour, and the brilliancy of her wit.” Sir William
adds, that Stillingfleet was a learned man, negligent
in his dress, and wearing gray stockings, which
attracted Admiral Boscawen’s notice, and caused the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
gallant seaman to call the assembly of these friends
the Bluestocking Society, as if to indicate that when
those brilliant friends met, it was not for the purpose
of forming a dressed assembly.</p>

<p>To one of the so-called Bluestocking Ladies, the
once renowned Literary Club owed its name. Sir
Joshua Reynolds proposed the formation of such a
club; Johnson joyfully acceded, and “the club” was
formed. Hawkins, one of the members, has left on
record that “a lady, distinguished by her beauty and
taste for literature, invited us two successive years to
dinner at her house.” Hawkins does not name the
hostess (opinion is divided between Mrs. Montagu,
Mrs. Vesey, and Mrs. Ord); but he ascribes her
hospitality to curiosity as to a desire to intermingle
with the conversation of the members the “charms
of her own.” This idea of “conversation” in place of
gambling and other fashionable follies, was the leading
idea with the ladies who share the merit of having
founded the Bluestocking assemblies. The hostess
who received the club “affected,” says Hawkins, “to
consider the members as literary men;” and he
thinks it probable that the club thence derived an
appellation which it never arrogated to itself. The
Bluestockings and the Literary Clubbists seem to
have had this in common: their discourse was miscellaneous,
chiefly literary; politics were alone excluded.
The last, however, were sometimes quietly
discussed in one or other of the groups into which
the assemblies under the leadership of ladies divided
themselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, being a thorough woman of business
as well as a recognised leader in social life, did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
not make her house in Hill Street a “court for the
votaries of the muses” all at once. She had a
wholesome horror of being in debt, and she indulged
her tastes only when her purse authorised the outlay.
In 1767, she completed the Chinese-room which had
charmed Madame du Bocage years before. “Mr.
Adams,” as Mrs. Montagu informed Lord Kames,
“has made me a cieling, and chimney-piece, and
doors which are pretty enough to make me a thousand
enemies. Envy,” she said, jestingly, “turns
livid at the first glimpse of them.”</p>

<p>At this time, Mrs. Montagu had been living in
Hill Street more than thirty years. It was not even
at the later period the well-macadamised and broadly
paved street it now is. A few of the original and
noble houses still dignify the street. Mrs. Montagu
began to reside there a short time before Lord
Chesterfield removed from Grosvenor Square to
Chesterfield House; namely, in 1748. In the June
of that year, Chesterfield wrote to Mr. Dayrolles: “I
am now extremely busy in moving to my new house,
where I must be before Michaelmas next.... As
my new house is situated among a parcel of thieves
and murderers, I shall have occasion for a house-dog.”
Chesterfield House is within a stone’s throw
of Hill Street. The “thieves and murderers” were
among the butchers of May Fair and Sheppard’s
Market—not then cleared out for such streets as
have since been erected on the site. Park Lane
was then Tyburn Lane, and what with the fair of six
weeks’ duration (with blackguardism and incidents of
horror that will not bear repeating), and the monthly
hangings at Tyburn, from which half the drunken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
and yelling spectators poured through May Fair, Hill
Street, and adjacent outlets on their way to home
and fresh scenes of riot,—between the fair, the
gallows, and the neighbouring rascalry,—the district
was not to be entered after dark without risk of the
wayfarer being stripped by robbers. Footpads were
as common between Hay Hill and Park Lane as
highwaymen between Hounslow and Bagshot. Now,
Hill Street looks as if no mounted gentleman of the
road had ever quietly ridden through it on a summer’s
evening westward, on felonious thoughts intent.
Chesterfield House stands, but new mansions occupy
its once brilliant gardens, whence all the gay spirits
have been driven. In that locality no longer can it
be said that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... round and round the ghosts of beauties glide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haunting the places where their honour died!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1770, Hill Street, still unpaved, was most
crowded with the carriages of visitors to Mrs. Montagu’s
rooms. In the assemblies held there, the
hostess had words for all, but she had no special
idols; and this was not always gratifying to those
who looked for idolatry. Boswell notices one night
when “a splendid company had assembled, consisting
of the most eminent literary characters. I thought
he (Johnson) seemed highly pleased with the respect
and attention that was shown him, and asked him on
our return home if he were not highly gratified by
his visit. ‘No, sir,’ said he; ‘not highly gratified,
yet I do not recollect to have passed many evenings
with fewer objections.’”</p>

<p>How “objectionable” Johnson could be to others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
is well known; but they took it good-naturedly.
Soame Jenyns having been roughly treated by the
doctor on one of these occasions, revenged himself
by writing an anticipatory epitaph. It was probably
read aloud at one of Mrs. Montagu’s coteries. The
original is preserved, with half a hundred sprightly
letters by Garrick, among the MSS. belonging to
Earl Spencer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Garrick was among the ladies who met in
Mrs. Montagu’s drawing-room, and she remained the
fast friend of the latter till death parted them.
About a quarter of a century had elapsed since, as
Eva Violetti, Mrs. Garrick had made her first appearance
on the stage as a dancer. In what guise
she made her début was, doubtless, laughingly alluded
to by the Bluestockings. The Earl of Strafford,
who died childless, in 1791, has left a record of the
fact in an unpublished letter (March, 1746) in the
Cathcart collection. “She surprised her audience at
her first appearance on the stage; for at her beginning
to caper, she showed a neat pair of black velvet
breeches, with roll’d stockings; but finding they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
were unusual in England, she changed them the next
time for a pair of white drawers.” This was a joke
for the more intimate circle in Hill Street. It is
probable that it was at the more exclusive gatherings
at Mrs. Montagu’s that the satirists, who had no
title to enter, flung their shafts. “Beattie used to
dwell with enthusiasm and delight,” says Sir William
Forbes, “on those more private parties into which he
had had the happiness of being admitted at Mrs.
Montagu’s, consisting of Lord Lyttelton, Mrs. Carter,
and one or two other most intimate friends, who
spent their evenings in an unreserved interchange of
thoughts; sometimes on critical and literary subjects;
sometimes on those of the most serious and interesting
nature.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu’s assemblies were held within-doors.
Other ladies varied the character of their entertainments.
Lady Clermont (for example) was not more
remarkable for her conversational parties than for her
al fresco gatherings. In May, 1773, when living in
St. James’s Place, she issued invitations to three
hundred dear friends, “to take tea and walk in the
Park.” It is said that the Duchess of Bedford, who
then resided on the site now occupied by the north
side of Bloomsbury Square, sent out cards to “take
tea and walk in the fields.” It was expected that
syllabubs would soon be milked in Berkeley Square,
around the statue of his Majesty. Walpole speaks
of being invited to Lady Clermont’s conversation
pieces. These conversation pieces led to such easy
manners, that etiquette was sometimes disregarded
when it was most expected. Lady Clermont, for
instance, being at a card-party at Gunnersbury, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
many royal personages, and many witty ones, including
Walpole, she remarked aloud that she was sure
the Duke of Portland was dying for a pinch of snuff!
and she pushed her own box toward him, across the
Princess Amelia. Her fluttered Royal Highness,
remembering that my lady had been much favoured
by the Queen of France, said: “Pray, madam, where
did you learn that breeding? Did the Queen of
France teach it to you?”</p>

<p>The district around Berkeley Square, Hay Hill,
Hill Street, etc., continued to be a dangerous district.
Lord Cathcart, in an unpublished letter to his son
William, dated December, 1774, affords an instance
of the peril which people ran on their way to the
houses of Mrs. Montagu, Lady Clermont, Lady
Brown, and other residents of that neighbourhood.
Lord Cathcart tells his son, that as his sisters and
Mr. Graham (afterward Lord Lyndoch) were going
to Lady Brown’s, in a coach, they were attacked by
footpads on Hay Hill. One opened the door and
demanded the company’s money. The future Lord
Lyndoch showed the stuff of which that gallant soldier
was made. He upset the robber who addressed
them, then jumped out and secured him. The confederate
took to his heels.</p>

<p>One night in the autumn of 1776, the house in
Hill Street was crowded. The French ambassador
and Mme. de Noailles were there, but the hero of the
night was Garrick, who electrified his audience by
reciting scenes from Macbeth and Lear. “Though
they had heard so much of you,” Mrs. Montagu wrote
to Roscius, “they had not the least idea such things
were within the compass of art and nature. Lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Spencer’s eyes were more expressive than any human
language.... She amazed them with telling them
how you could look like a simpleton in Abel Drugger,
had many comic arts equally surprising, when murderous
daggers and undutiful daughters were out of
the question.” Mme. de Noailles was so profuse, as
she descended the stairs, in thanks for the great
intellectual enjoyment, that Mrs. Montagu was afraid
she would forget herself, and, by a false step, break
her neck. She fervently hoped, too, that Garrick
had not caught cold by going out into the air, “when
warmed with that fire of genius which animated
every look and gesture.”</p>

<p>In March, 1779, Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale:
“On Monday, I came late to Mrs. Vesey. Mrs.
Montagu was there. I called for the print” (of
Mrs. Montagu, in the costume of Anne Boleyn)
“and had good words. The evening was not brilliant
but I had thanks for my company.” In October
of the same year, Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale:
“I have been invited twice to Mrs. Vesey’s <i>conversation</i>,
but have not gone.”</p>

<p>Johnson has described a scene at one of the Bluestocking
assemblies (Mrs. Ord’s) where, as he wrote
to Mrs. Thrale: “I met one Mrs. Buller, a travelled
lady of great spirit and some consciousness of her
own abilities. We had a contest of gallantry an hour
long, so much to the diversion of the company, that
at Ramsay’s, last night, in a crowded room, they
would have pitted us again. There were Smelt, and
the Bishop of St. Asaph, who comes to every place,
and Lord Monboddo, and Sir Joshua, and ladies out
of tale.” On another night he was at Miss Monkton’s,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the then young lady who many may remember
as the old and eccentric Lady Cork. Mr. Langton,
in a letter to Boswell, thus paints the groups of Bluestockings
at the house of the lady who shared with
Mrs. Montagu the glory of being their founder: “The
company consisted chiefly of ladies, among whom were
the Dowager Duchess of Portland, the Duchess of
Beaufort, whom, I suppose from her rank, I must
name before her mother, Mrs. Boscawen, and her
eldest sister, Mrs. Lewson, who was likewise there,
Lady Lucan, Lady Clermont, and others of note, both
for their station and understandings. Amongst other
gentlemen were Lord Althorp, Lord Macartney, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Lord Lucan, Mr. Wraxall (whose
book you have probably seen, the ‘Tour to the Northern
Parts of Europe,’ a very agreeable, ingenious man),
Dr. Warren, Mr. Pepys the master in chancery, and
Dr. Barnard the Provost of Eton. As soon as Dr.
Johnson had come in and had taken the chair, the
company began to collect round him till they became
not less than four, if not five, deep, those behind
standing and listening over the heads of those that
were sitting near him. The conversation for some
time was between Dr. Johnson and the Provost of
Eton, while the others contributed occasionally their
remarks.” How well Mrs. Montagu could converse,
Johnson has portrayed in a few comprehensive words
to Mrs. Thrale: “Mrs. Montagu is <i>par pluribus</i>.
Conversing with her, you may find variety in one.”
These assemblies were miscalled and sneered at only
by the blockheads. Walpole was scarcely sincere
when he affected to laugh at them. He not only
attended them, but stirred others to do so. Four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
years after this, he writes to Hannah More: “When
will you blue stocking yourself and come among us?”</p>

<p>In 1781, Hannah More took the Bluestockings
for a theme for her sprightly little poem, which she
entitled “Bas Bleu,” and dedicated to Mrs. Vesey.
In a few introductory words, the author explained the
origin and character of the assemblies to which the
well-known epithet was given. “Those little societies
have been sometimes misrepresented. They
were composed of persons distinguished in general
for their rank, talents, or respectable character, who
were frequently at Mrs. Vesey’s and a few other
houses, for the sole purpose of conversation, and
were different in no respect from other parties, but
that the company did not play at cards.”</p>

<p>Hannah More describes the hours she passed at
these parties as “pleasant and instructive.” She
states that she found there learning without pedantry,
good taste without affectation, and conversation without
calumny, levity, or any censurable error.</p>

<p>From the following lines, the names of the founders
of the new assemblies may be learnt. Their
object was to rescue—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... Society o’errun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Whist, that desolating Hun;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and from despotic Quadrille, the “Vandal of colloquial
wit.” Three ladies, according to Hannah More,
effected the reformation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The vanquish’d triple crown to you, (Mrs. Vesey)</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Rescued the ravaged realms of taste.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Among the genial and the lofty spirits found in the
rooms of those ladies, and of Mrs. Ord and others,
Hannah More names accomplished Lyttelton, witty
Pulteney, polished, sometimes sarcastic, Walpole, with
humourists who charmed and never wounded, critics
who recorded merits before they looked for defects,
Christian poets, skilled physicians, honest lawyers,
men of all shades of politics, with princes of the
church, ladies of ton, and “reasonable beauties.”
Roscius (Garrick), Mars (Mason), Cato (Johnson),
and Hortensius (Burke), are recorded amongst those
who, at those intellectual gatherings, at various times,
led the conversation, and made it as glorious as Hannah
More, who shared therein, proceeds to describe
it.</p>

<p>The chief incident in Mrs. Montagu’s life in the
year 1781, one which threw a shade over several succeeding
years, was her quarrel with Doctor Johnson,
founded on certain depreciatory passages in Johnson’s
“Life of Lyttelton.” When Johnson sent to Mrs.
Montagu his MS. of the Life before it went to press,
the homage implied that he submitted it to her judgment
for approval or correction. Mrs. Montagu disapproved
the tone, and Johnson sent his copy to press
without altering a word or modifying a sentiment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Johnson’s account of Lyttelton seems
fair enough to readers of the present day, though it
greatly offended the lady who paid Lyttelton a homage
of reverential affection. Johnson duly records
Lyttelton’s precocity at Eton, and his creditable
attempt in his “Blenheim,” to become a poet, at
Oxford. His political career, as the opponent of
Walpole, by whose fall Lyttelton came into office,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
is told without passion, and Lyttelton’s honest progress
from honest doubt to honest conviction of the
truth of Christianity is delicately and sympathetically
narrated. His merits as a landlord, his good fortune
as a politician, his fidelity as a friend, and his anxiety
to be at least accurate as an historian, are chronicled
without reserve. The details of Lyttelton’s dignified
death might have made his best friend forget and forgive
the criticisms on some of his writings. Mrs.
Montagu might forget a part, but she could not forgive
an expression of compassionate contempt, which
was worse than adverse criticism. She might forget
that Johnson spoke of “The Progress of Love,” as
verses that “cant of shepherds and flocks, and crooks
dressed with flowers.” She may have been only momentarily
stung by the censurer’s remark that, in the
“Persian Letters,” the ardour for liberty which found
expression there, was only such “as a man of genius
always catches when he enters the world, and always
suffers to cool as he passes forward.” She might herself
have sneered at Johnson’s praise of the “Advice
to Belinda,” on the score of its purity, truth, vigour,
elegance, and prudence, whereas, with some merits,
it is a poem which no one now would dare to read
aloud, where it was meant to be read, to Belindas of
the time being. The paragraph in the Life which
gave Mrs. Montagu such exquisite pain was the following,
in reference to the “Dialogues of the Dead:”
“When they were first published, they were kindly
commended by the critical reviewers; and poor
Lyttelton, with humble gratitude, returned his acknowledgments
in a note which I have read; acknowledgments
either for flattery or justice.” This paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
gave the great offence. The words “poor Lyttelton”
rendered it almost unpardonable. Notwithstanding
the offence, Mrs. Montagu subsequently invited Johnson
to dinner; but she could not treat him with her
old cordiality, nor would she fall into conversation
with him. General Paoli sat next to the doctor.
Johnson turned to him and remarked, “You see, sir,
I am no longer the man for Mrs. Montagu!” He
was not indifferent to this condition of things. “Mrs.
Montagu, sir,” he afterward said to a friend, “has
dropt me. Now, sir, there are people whom one
should like very well to drop, but would not wish to
be dropt by.”</p>

<p>Good-natured friends embittered the quarrel. Mrs.
Vesey “sounded the trumpet,” as was remarked by
Walpole, who added: “It has not, I believe, produced
any altercation; but at a Bluestocking meeting, held
by Lady Lucan, Mrs. Montagu and Johnson kept at
different ends of the chamber, and set up altar against
altar there. She told me, as a mark of her high displeasure,
that she would not ask him to dinner again.
I took her aside and fomented the quarrel, and wished
I could have made Dagon and Ashtaroth scold in
Coptic.” Walpole (who in this quarrel was quite as
malicious as Mrs. Vesey, whom he affected to laugh
at, was indiscreet) called Johnson in another letter
referring to this quarrel, “Demagorgon,” and says
that the doctor and the lady kept aloof “like the
west from the east.” He states that Lady Lucan,
whose house was the scene of the comedy, “had assembled
a Bluestocking meeting in imitation of Mrs.
Vesey’s Babels. It was so blue, it was quite mazarin
blue. There were Soame Jenyns, Persian Jones, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Sherlock, the new court, Mr. Courtenay, besides the
outpensioners of Parnassus.” And besides those
named, every man of whom was a man of intellect,
there was Mr. Horace Walpole himself, who certainly
was present, because he knew he would not be among
fools, though he pretended to go as if he found
amusement in their folly. He seems, in the above
extract, to recognise the good-natured Irish lady, Mrs.
Vesey (whose house in Bolton Row, or subsequently
in Clarges Street, was hospitably open to people of
merit—proved or promised), as the founder of assemblies
to which the slang name of <i>bas-bleu</i> assemblies
was given. Referring to Mrs. Montagu, with
whom he was very glad to dine, he says (in this year,
1781), “She is one of my principal entertainments at
Mrs. Vesey’s, who collects all the graduates and candidates
for fame, where they vie with one another till
they are as unintelligible as the good folks at Babel.”
We should honour any lady of the present century
who, like Mrs. Vesey, Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Ord, Lady
Lucan, and others in the last century, welcomed to
their houses, not only all the graduates, but also the
candidates for fame. Johnson himself was annoyed
when not invited to those intellectual meetings. In
1780, he writes, “I told Lady Lucan how long it was
since she sent to me; but she said, I must consider
how the world rolls about her.” From the lips of
the guests whom Walpole met at the houses indicated
he could not carry away the stories that he
loved so well as to insert them, in his most exquisite
hand, into folios carefully arranged. These still
exist; they illustrate phases of life among high-born
women and men of the last century who were graduates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
not in fame, but in infamy. Nothing could well
be worse, except the infamy of him who must have
passed many a night in penning that unutterably
horrible and scandalous chronicle. The chronicler,
on the other hand, is not to be blamed for noting the
little affectations of those whom he encountered, as
in the following example, the date of which is 1781:
“I met,” he says to Lady Ossory, “Mrs. Montagu
the other night at a visit. She told me she had been
alone the whole preceding day, quite hermetically
sealed. I was very glad she was uncorked, or I might
have missed that piece of learned nonsense.” However,
“Mrs. Montagu,” writes Mrs. Boscawen to Mrs.
Delany, “is in perfect health and spirits in her
Château Portman.” But, in Montagu House, Portman
Square, the so-called Bluestockings were much
less at home than in Hill Street. Nevertheless, there,
and at similar houses supposed to be of a Bluestocking
class, Walpole was much more amused than when
he was at the Princess Amelia’s, at Gunnersbury, with
the “cream of the cream” of Europe, and playing
commerce with the grandest of them. He never had
to say of himself at Mrs. Montagu’s, as he did of his
doings at the Princess’s, “Played three pools of
commerce till ten. I am afraid I was tired, and
gaped!”</p>

<p>There died in this year, 1781, a Provincial Bluestocking,—who
has been delicately praised by Miss
Seward, and furiously attacked and ridiculed by Horace
Walpole,—Mrs. Miller, the neighbour of Mrs.
Scott and Lady Bab Montagu at Batheaston. There
is an old story that Walpole, declining to recognise
a man in London whom he had known at Bath, explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
himself by saying, that he would be happy
to know the same individual again—at Bath! So,
with regard to literary or <i>bas-bleu</i> assemblies, he
acknowledged those only of London. Provincial
meetings he treated as shams, and covered them with
ridicule. Mrs. Miller’s house,—to which she invited
a rather mixed assembly of persons distinguished for
intellectual merit, or persons who were distinguished
only by the accident of birth,—Walpole mis-named
the “puppet-show Parnassus at Batheaston” (or Pindus)—“a
new Parnassus, composed of three laurels,
a myrtle-tree, a weeping willow, and a view of the
Avon, which has been new-christened Helicon.”
Miss Rich, Lady Lyttelton’s sister, took Walpole to
dine there.... He ridiculed his hosts, described
Captain Miller as officious, though good-natured, who,
with his wife, had caught “taste,” and outlived their
income. Having (like wise and honest people) recovered
themselves by living economically abroad, they
resumed their old home with improved habits.
“Alas!” says Walpole, “Mrs. Miller is returned a
beauty, a genius, a Sappho, a tenth Muse, as romantic
as Mademoiselle de Scuderi, and as sophisticated
as Mrs. Vesey. They have introduced <i>bouts-rimés</i> as
a new discovery. They hold a Parnassus fair every
Thursday, give out rhymes and themes, and all the
flux and quality of Bath contend for the prizes. A
Roman vase, decked with pink ribbons and myrtle,
receives the poetry, which is drawn out every festival.
Six judges of these Olympic games retire and select
the brightest compositions, which the respective successful
acknowledge, kneel to Mrs. Calliope Miller,
kiss her fair hand, and are crowned by it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
myrtle.... The collection is printed, published,—yes,
on my faith, there are <i>bouts-rimés</i> on a buttered
muffin, by her Grace the Duchess of Northumberland,
receipts to make them, by Corydon the Venerable,
alias George Pitt; others, very pretty, by Lord
Palmerston; some by Lord Carlisle; many by Mrs.
Miller herself, that have no fault but wanting
metre.... There never was anything so entertaining
or so dull.” It may be added here, that Lord
Palmerston’s lines “On Beauty” are more than
“very pretty,” and that the duchess could not avoid
the subject laughed at, since two of the rhymes given
to her were “puffing” and “muffin,” and she came
out of the difficulty with skill and dexterity. There
are, perhaps, few people in a mixed company at the
present time, who could more pleasantly dance such
an intellectual hornpipe in similar fetters.</p>

<p>Miss Seward modifies Walpole’s satirical account
without disturbing the main facts. She adds, with
reference to the volumes of these prize poems then
published: “The profits have been applied to the
benefit of a charity at Bath, so that Lady Miller’s
institute” (her husband had been knighted) “was not
only calculated to awaken and cultivate ingenuity, but
to serve the purposes of benevolence and charity.”
Walpole suppressed the fact that any one profited by
the assemblies at Lady Miller’s, of whom and of
whose husband who presumed to have Walpole’s
predilection for <i>virtu</i>, Horace says: “They make
themselves completely ridiculous, which is a pity,
as they are good-natured, well-meaning people.”</p>

<p>Some fine spirits contributed to the Batheaston
vase, and their contributions, for which the writers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
generally had a fortnight’s notice,—the one theme
being given to all competitors,—are often marked
by power, grace, fancy, and, in the comic pieces,
rough humour. On one occasion, some scandalous
verses were dropped into the vase, the reading of
which in the very first lines called up blushes on the
cheeks of the modest, and caused suspicion to rest
on the rather audacious Christopher Anstey. “An
enemy hath done this,” was the sum of the general
comment. Lady Miller’s death soon followed. Miss
Seward has generously spoken of her really intellectual
friend, though she begins with a curious figure
of speech. “Lady Miller,” she says, “was surrounded
by a hornet’s nest,” which was, as she goes on to
state in more common sense style, “composed of those
who were disappointed in their expectations of being
summoned to her intellectual feast, and of others
whose rhyming offerings could neither obtain the
wreath, nor be admitted to a place in her miscellany.
‘Who knows not the active malice of wounded
vanity to blot the fairest worth and blast the brightest
fame?’ From its venom, excellence cannot even
find repose in the grave, and it never fails to descend
upon those who dare defend the claims of the
deceased.”</p>

<p>Reference has been made, in a previous page (see
p. 46) to Boswell’s error in stating that the Bluestocking
Clubs were originally established about this
time, 1781, when Hannah More was writing of them
as institutions, the chief members of which had already
passed away. The amiable philosopher and thoroughly
honest, modest, and accomplished man, Benjamin
Stillingfleet (the grandson of the bishop), from whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
they are supposed to derive their name, had been
dead ten years. In his early days, he made the
ascent of Mont Blanc; his last were spent in Kensington
Barracks, where his salary as barrack-master
satisfied his wants and left him wherewith to help
those who were in need. He contributed toward the
social reform commenced by Johnson, Miss Mulso
(Chapone), and Mrs. Montagu in 1750, a poem on
“Conversation.” It rings with echoes of Pope, and
lays down some very excellent rules that, implicitly
followed, would make conversation impossible. Boswell
refers to Hannah More’s poem on the Bluestockings
without noticing her record that so many
of the persons named in it were then dead. The
institution, in fact, was in “the sere, the yellow
leaf,” and one, at least, of its old leaders was weary.
In 1782, when Mrs. Montagu was established in her
palace (as Wraxall says the Italians would call, and
as many English people did call, it), in Portman
Square, her assemblies were more crowded than ever.
She herself, queening it beneath the ceiling painted
by Angelica Kaufmann, felt, or affected to feel, a
little weary of her splendour.</p>

<p>“I think,” she wrote to Lord Kames, in 1782,
“the calm autumn of life, as well as of the year, has
many advantages. Both have a peculiar serenity—a
genial tranquility. We are less busy and agitated,
because the hope of the spring and the vivid delights
of the summer are over; but these tranquil seasons
have their appropriate enjoyments, and a well-regulated
mind sees everything beautiful that is in the
order of nature.”</p>

<p>In 1785, Cumberland took the new assemblies, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Montagu House, for the subject of an essay in <i>The
Observer</i>. He places Mrs. Montagu, under the
name of Vanessa, in the foreground, and mingles
praise with mockery. He does not refer to the
slang word by which the assemblies conducted by
ladies were known; he calls Vanessa’s assembly the
Feast of Reason. Throughout life, according to
this essayist, Vanessa had been a beauty or a wit,
whose vanity had this good quality, namely, that it
stimulated her to exercise charity, good nature, affability,
and a splendid hospitality,—qualities which
carried her into all the circles of fine people, and
crowded all the fine people into hers.... In her
saloons there was a welcome for every follower of
science, every sort of genius,—a welcome which
extended, so the satirical essayist affirms, from the
manufacturer of toothpicks to the writer of an epic
poem. Authors looked to her for fees in return for
dedications; and players, for patronage and presents
on their benefit nights.</p>

<p>According to Cumberland, the lady of Montagu
House was seated, like the statue of Athenian Minerva,
incensed by the breath of philosophers, poets,
orators, and their intellectual brethren. Hannah
More states, on the contrary, that at the original
Bluestocking parties, previous to 1781, the company,
instead of being a formal unity, were broken up into
numberless groups. Something, too, of this fashion
seems to be referred to by Cumberland, who describes
Vanessa as going from one to another, making
mathematicians quote Pindar, persuading masters
in chancery to write novels, and Birmingham men to
stamp rhymes as fast as buttons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>We are further told that the books on Vanessa’s
table (and Mrs. Montagu often complained of the
number of presentation copies which were sent to
her) indicated who were among her guests. This
little civility is sneered at, and she from whom it
emanated was also occasionally sneered at by some
of her guests; which would have been more natural
than courteous if the lady of the house ever dressed
herself, as Cumberland describes her with boundless
exaggeration, in a dress on which were embroidered
the ruins of Palmyra! The same exaggeration is
applied to the description of the company, among
whom figure cracked philosophers and crazy dreamers,
with Johnson alone grand, powerful, majestic, eloquent,
and ill-mannered.</p>

<p>Next, and perhaps equal with Johnson, is the unmistakable
presence of Mrs. Siddons, who, since the
October night of 1782, when she took the town by
the passion and pathos of Isabella, had been the idol
of the time. There she sits at Mrs. Montagu’s on
a sofa, leaning on one elbow, in a passive attitude,
counting, or seeming to count, the sticks of her fan,
as homage and compliments are profusely laid at
her feet. To silly questions she has sensible replies—replies
which indicate the queries: “I strove to
do it the best I could; I shall do as the manager
bids me; I always endeavour to make the part I am
about my best part;” and, “I never study anything
but my author.” There is, probably, no exaggeration
in this; and the more fantastic side of Mrs.
Montagu’s character is not overcharged in the incident
that follows. The hostess introduces a “young
novitiate of the Muses,” in a white frock. A fillet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
of flowers crowns her long hair, and the novice, advancing
to Melpomene, addresses her with—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O thou, whom Nature’s goddess calls her own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pride of the stage, and fav’rite of the town;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which puts poor Mrs. Siddons to the blush, and half
of those who are within hearing to flight.</p>

<p>In 1790, the so-called Bluestocking Club puzzled
dwellers in country places. Nestor, of Bark Place,
Salop, was sadly perplexed as to what the club was,
and also as to the meaning of another slang term
then prevailing. He writes to Sylvanus Urban accordingly,
with a sort of apology for being old and
living in remote Shropshire. Among others, he
frequently meets with the term “white bear,” applied
to many characters of eminence; and often
reads of “the Bluestocking Club,” which he knows
consists chiefly of the literati. But being ignorant
of the derivation and propriety of application of those
terms, he will be much obliged to any correspondent
who will condescend to inform him. It does not
appear that any correspondent, not even the editor
himself, could enlighten Nestor, either as to the bear
or the club.</p>

<p>Among the latest writers who have, as Hannah
More said, misrepresented these intellectual parties
is Miss Mitford. She speaks of Batheaston in her
“Recollections of a Literary Life” (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1857) as
“memorable for the Bluestocking vagaries of a certain
Lady Miller, a Somersetshire Clemence Isaure,
who, some seventy years ago, offered prizes for the
best verses thrown into an antique urn; the prize
consisting, not of a golden violet, but a wreath of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
laurel, and the whole affair producing, as was to be
expected, a great deal more ridicule than poetry.”
In Lady Miller’s case, the original object, “conversation,”
was lost sight of; and some vanity was mixed
up with the doings of the Batheaston Muse. But to
stir up even dull minds to make an attempt to write
some sort of poetry was an intellectual exercise at
least as beneficial as the process which counts honours,
and eternally asks, “What’s trumps?”</p>

</div>

<p>Returning to the year 1781, it is to be observed
that after that year, the Bluestocking assemblies
gradually died out. Cumberland’s caricature of them
excited the displeasure of good Queen Charlotte; and
Miss Burney, who recognised herself as alluded to
under the guise of an Arcadian nymph, has given a
description of a breakfast at the palace in Portman
Square, which did not the least resemble that which
was described, a generation earlier, by Madame du
Bocage. The later breakfast was sumptuous, gorgeous,
overcrowded. In splendour of company,
banquet, and locality, it could not be surpassed; and
hundreds were there. But we miss the more select
number of intellectual people, who used to fill the
smaller house in Hill Street, where the Bluestockings
met, and dignified their place of meeting. From
the year 1781, Mrs. Montagu’s letters take a graver
tone, which is occasionally enlivened by some of her
old brilliancy of expression. The following letter is
without date of the year, but it was written when
Hill Street was about being abandoned for the palace
in Portman Square.</p>

<p>“<i>Hill Street, 2d March, 1781.</i> ... You will
find this town more gay and splendid than ever; so
little effect has the combined evil of wars, and devastation,
and hurricanes. The profuse liberality to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Vestris, ye dancer, and the enthusiastic admiration of
his capers exceeds all the folly I ever knew. Making
a visit to a wife of one of the <i>corps diplomatique</i>, the
other night, I had the mortification of overhearing a
group of foreigners ridiculing the English for the
bustle made about Vestris.</p>

<p>“... I have already on my chimney-piece a multitude
of cards for assemblies for every day till near
the end of passion week. I hope some of the fine
people will spend the Easter holidays in ye country;
for such a succession of assemblies is tiresome.</p>

<p>“... I have, greatly to my satisfaction, got my
new house finished and fit for habitation; and I
should have taken possession at this very time, but
the wise people and the medical people say it would
be dangerous to go into a new house just after the
winter damp.... As I always leave London early
in May, I was convinced it was not worth while to
run hazard for a few weeks’ pleasure. It is much
the fashion to go and see my house, and I receive
many compliments upon its elegance and magnificence,
but what most recommends it to me is its convenience
and cheerfulness. A good house is a great
comfort in old age and among the few felicities that
money will procure.</p>

<p>“... I shall be much obliged to you if you will
bring to London Thou’s History, which I lent to
your caro sposo five years ago. I suppose he has
long done with it, and I want to read it.”</p>

<p>“<i>London, December ye 4th, 1781.</i> ... At this
time of ye year, the great city is solitary, silent, and
quiet. Its present state makes a good preface to the
succeeding months of crowd, noise, and bustle....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
One always finds some friends in town; a few agreable
people may at any time be gathered together;
and, for my own part, I think one seldom passes the
whole of one’s time more agreably than before the
meeting of parliament in January; and this never
appeared more strongly to me than this year, when
so excellent a house was ready to receive me.</p>

<p>“... As age is apt to bring with it a certain
degree of melancholy and discontent, I endeavour to
prevent its having that effect, by sympathising in the
joy of my young friends and of improving the objects
about me.... As fast as time wrinkles my forehead,
I smooth the grounds about Sandleford, or embellish
my town habitation. In a little while, I shall never
see anything belonging to me that is not pretty,
except when I behold myself in the looking-glass....
At Sandleford, I can assure you, Mr. Brown
has not neglected any of its capabilities. He is
forming it into a lovely pastoral—a sweet Arcadian
scene. In not attempting more, he adapts his scheme
to the character of the place and my purse. We
shall not erect temples to heathen gods, build proud
bridges over humble rivulets, or do any of the marvellous
things suggested by caprice, and indulged by
the wantonness of wealth. The noble rooms which
Mr. Wyatt was building when you were at Sandleford
are now finishing with the greatest simplicity.</p>

<p>“... To-morrow is look’d to with anxious expectation,
as it will in some measure declare on what
terms peace may be obtain’d. I believe all the belligerent
powers are tir’d of the war. But what difficulties
the cunning of statesmen, the pride of kings,
or the caprice of the people may put in the way, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
cannot tell. The Spaniards are proud, the French
are petulant, the Dutch are avaricious, and the English
are a happy compound of all these things.</p>

<p>“... My steward (from Northumberland), who
made his annual visit to me in November, told me
that north of my estates there were many fields of
oats and barley lying under the snow. I have been
very busy with him, settling our year’s accounts, for
these ten days past.</p>

<p>“Lord Edward Bentinck is going to be married
to Miss Cumberland. The Bishop of St. Asaph’s
eldest daughter to the learned and ingenious Mr.
Jones.”</p>

<p>“<i>Portman Square, January ye 17th, 1782.</i> ...
Montagu,” she writes to her sister-in-law, “returns
to me only at Christmas and the long vacation. The
last is spent entirely at Sandleford; for I think the
worst thing one can do by young persons is to give
them a habit of restlessness, which is now so prevalent
in the fine world, that all domestick duties,
even the tender parental attentions, are neglected
for it....</p>

<p>“I think you did wisely, as well as kindly, in letting
my neice partake of the pleasures of your neighbourhood.
To be within the sound of a ball, and not
allow’d to go to it, must seem a hardship to a young
person.... Life never knows the return of spring,
and I am always an advocate for their gathering the
primroses of their time. A young person not allow’d
to please himself, sometimes will lose any desire to
please others.</p>

<p>“I think it would be very desirable for my brother
to be a prebend of Canterbury. There is a local<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
dignity in it, and a clergyman in the neighbourhood
of Canterbury ought to have a stall in the cathedral,
in which he can take a nap with decorum. I should
think from the kind disposition the primate has
shown for the family, he will lend a favorable ear
to my brother’s application.... So great is his
respect and tenderness for his brother, Sir William,
that perhaps the request, supported by him, would
have additional force.</p>

<p>“... I am glad my good friend, Mr. Brown, is
employed by so rich a person as Lord Bristol. Such
an income as his lordship’s cannot be annually expended
on domestick expenses without foolish prodigality
and waste.... I am very glad Mr. Brown
likes me as a correspondent; for I am obliged to
make a very paltry figure to him as an employer.
He is narrowly circumscrib’d, both in space and
expense; but he really gives the poor widow and her
paltry plans as great attention as he could bestow on
an unlimited commission and an unbounded space.
He has made a plan to make my grounds, in prospect
of the house and new rooms, very pleasing, and will
execute as much of it every year as I choose, the
expense being agreed upon, which will keep pace
with the improvements. The only way to cheat old
Time is, while it robs us of some enjoyments and
pleasures, to be providing new ones. I am a great
deal younger, I think, since I came into my new
House, from its cheerfulness; and, from its admirable
conveniences and comforts, less afraid of growing
old. My friends and acquaintances are much pleased
with it, ... and I am not afraid to confess the
pleasure I take in their finding it agreable and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
commodious for company. But the great satisfaction
I feel, as its inhabitant, I dare confess to few; for
few would hear it without envy. People are not very
envious at any advantages they see another possess,
if they do not perceive those advantages add to the
happiness of the possessor. Many a wrinkled old
virgin makes it a necessary article of merit in a
blooming girl, that she should not know she is
handsome.</p>

<p>“... The Bishop of Durham is going to be
married to Miss Boughton. She is a very proper
Person for a wife to a grave bishop—a woman of
good family, good character, and good temper.</p>

<p>“... Pray have my neices read ‘Le Théâtre de
l’Education,’ by Mme. de Genlis? If they have not,
I will get it for them.... I think it is one of the
prettiest books that has been written for young
persons. The author is governess to the Duc de
Chartres’ children.”</p>

<p>Even Walpole acknowledged the beauty of the
house which Mrs. Montagu had built for her old age
and for her heirs—till Lord Rokeby vacated it
recently, the ground lease having “fallen in,” and
the edifice passing to the ground landlord. “I
dined,” writes Walpole to Mason, in February, 1782,
“on Tuesday with the Harcourts, at Mrs. Montagu’s
new palace, and was much surprised. Instead
of vagaries, it is a noble, simple edifice. Magnificent,
yet no gilding. It is grand, not tawdry, not larded,
and embroidered, and pomponned with shreds, and
remnants, and clinquant, like all the harlequinades
of Adam, which never let the eye repose an
instant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>The next letter is addressed to the writer’s niece,
Miss Robinson.</p>

<p>“<i>July ye 9th, 1782.</i> ... I was, in my youth,
directed in the choice of friends by their solid merit
and established character, which was oftener found
in persons older than myself than in my contemporaries.
If from hence I have often wept for
dying, I have never been obliged to blush for my
living, friends.... The chief honour and felicity of
my life has been derived from the superior merit
of my friends; and, from my experience, I would,
above all things, recommend to every young person
to endeavour to connect themselves with persons
whom they can esteem, and, indeed, reverence, rather
than with those whose understandings and virtues
they think merely on a level with, or, perhaps,
inferior to, their own.... Principles, opinions, and
habits are acquired and formed from those with
whom we live and converse most.... Be cautious,
be delicate, be a little ambitious, my dear neice, in
the choice of your friends. I would be far from
inculcating a supercilious contempt for persons of
weak understanding, or a censorious condemnation
of their levity of manners. Humility and charity are
the greatest virtues, and let them ever guide your
manners and regulate your conversation.... Be
assured that the wisest persons are the least severe,
and the most virtuous are the most charitable.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sandleford, July 9, 1782.</i> ... I had a great
deal of occupation of a more important kind, which
was the examination and payment of ye workmen
who had been employed in building and adorning the
said house.... As I got everything accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
before I left London, I had the satisfaction of getting
a receit in full of all demands from the various
artificers. I will own my taste is unfashionable, but
there is to me a wonderful charm in those words ‘in
full of all demands.’ My house never appeared to me
so noble, so splendid, so pleasant, so convenient, as
when I had paid off every shilling of debt it had
incurred. The worst of haunted houses, in my
opinion, are those haunted by duns.</p>

<p>“... Mr. Wyatt has nearly completed what belonged
to the architect; and Mr. Brown, by removing
a good deal of ground and throwing it down
below, to raise what was too low, while he sank what
was too high, has much improved the view to the
south; and, having, at my request, made a fanlight
over the east window, so that the arch formed by
the trees is now visible, these rooms are the most
beautiful imaginable. With the shelter, comfort,
and convenience of walls and roofs, you have a
beautiful passage and the green shade of a grove....
The celebrated Mr. Brown has already beautified
our pastoral scenes extreamly.</p>

<p>“... I can easily give you credit when you say
you love society, because I know society loves you,
and I am perfectly of the opinion of the common
maxim, that nobody lives out of the world who is fit
to live in it. Now your husband’s party have got into
power, I have no doubt but they will bestow a prebendary
upon him, if he asks them. However, his
income will very well afford your spending some
months in London every winter.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sandleford, June ye 16th 1783.</i> ... You must
know, as many authors with whom I have not any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
personal acquaintance do me the favour to send me
their works, I found the carriage of them to be
amongst my weekly expenses during the summer.
So, of late, if I make a short excursion into the
country, I order the literature to wait until my
return. Or, if I go for a longer time, to be sent
down at proper opportunities, with the tea, or groceries,
or some other of the vulgar necessaries of life.
So my dear nephew’s letter was supposed to come
with a pamphlet from a bookseller’s shop, and my
porter kept it, with other things from the same
source, till my return from Bath.</p>

<p>“... I found Sandleford improv’d by the attentions
of the great Mr. Brown. My pleasure in those
improvements was mix’d with regret for his death....
Brown was certainly a man of great genius....
Happily for me, he made a plan for all that is intended
to be done here. As I do not allow my
yearly expenses to exceed my yearly income, I go on
softly; so that the plan will hardly be completed by
this time two years.</p>

<p>“... I dare say my brother has read with great
pleasure Mr. Potter’s ‘Enquiry into some Passages
of Doctor Johnson’s Lives of the Poets.’ Mr. Potter
has also ably vindicated his friend Mr. Gray’s Odes,
etc., from cruel and unjust criticism, and this is done
with great wit, taste, and good manners,—ingredients
rarely put into the bitters of criticism. Modern
witts and modern orators are apt to fall into the
Billingsgate style, and from every kind of chastisement,
made more severe and outrageous than the
fault it should correct, one takes the part of the
culprit against the harshness of the corrector.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Sandleford, September ye 30th, 1783.</i> ... We are
all very well and very happy; these are the best articles
a country journal can contain, and most likely to be
found in a journal when ambitious pursuits and
tumultuous pleasures are perfectly excluded.</p>

<p>“... There is a mode of taking exercise which,
from my own experience, I think I shall recommend
to all my friends who are not riders, and that is a
one-horse chair. Sir Richard Jebb, just before I left
London, advis’d me to the use of this carriage. I
objected to it, as unpleasant and unsafe. He assur’d
me, that would I allow him to order me one of his
coachmaker, after a model of one he had used on
every kind of roads, he would answer for my finding
it easy and secure. To this I consented, and, in a
very obliging manner, he attended almost daily to
see it was properly constructed, and, about six weeks
ago, he wrote me word it was finished. I sent to
London for it; and I find it the most delightful way
of taking exercise imaginable. I take an airing
sometimes of sixteen or seventeen miles (ye going
and return included), and I am never weary while
abroad, nor fatigued when I get home. My machine
is hung so low, I am exalted but little above the
grazing herds, and at ye same time can hear distinctly
the song of the skylark above my head. No
rural sight or rural sound is intercepted. Miss Gregory
is my charioteer: she prides herself more on
caution than dexterity, so avoids everything that
could alarm me. As my driver is young, I chose an
old horse to draw me; but so much has every danger
been obviated by the construction of the carriage, I
believe I should be very safe with a steed of more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
vivacity and spirit. If the weather is doubtful, my
post-chaise follows, that we may take shelter against
its inclemencies. I am much pleased with this prescription
of Sir Richard Jebb’s.</p>

<p>“... We are doing a great piece of work in
feathers. Every sort of feather is useful; so shall
be much obliged if you can collect some for me.”</p>

<p>The old formality toward her sister-in-law never
changed, as the following letter will show:</p>

<p>“<i>November 26, 1783.</i> ... You mention, my dear
madam, with regret that you had not asked me to
dine; but you wrong your hospitality, for you offered
me a very comfortable dinner; but knowing, in your
unsettled state at Burfield, dining guests must be
very troublesome, I had calculated and contrived all
things so as to make you merely a noonday visit. To
tell you the truth, I am so afraid of my postillion and
servants getting a too great dose of ale at the houses
of gentlemen in a country neighbourhood, that I make
a rule never to dine from home. I have enjoy’d your
kind and elegant hospitality at your house in Kent,
and am sure the same spirit would ever exert itself to
give an agreeable welcome to your friends.</p>

<p>“... Mr. Barret has been very judicious in his
choice of Mr. Wyatt for his architect. He has a
most happy art of improving an old house. Where a
part is to be extended beyond the first intention, the
additions should be Gothick; for symmetry not being
the object of the Gothick architects, irregularity is
not considered an imperfection in their designs. Additions
made to houses in any other taste destroy the
intended proportions, and introduce confusion and
deformity. I am more a friend to the Gothick on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
outside than within; for, unless by great expense and
care, the Gothick fitting-up is clumsy and gloomy.
Mr. Walpole tells me Mr. Wyatt has made a most
beautiful design for Mr. Barret. I shall make my
ingenious friend show it to me when he has leisure.</p>

<p>“Pray do you not begin to entertain hopes that you
may one day sail in the air to our planet? Miss
Gregory went yesterday to see our air-balloon
launched. I had letters to write, and expected company
to dine with me and to stay the evening, so I
could not find time to attend this aerial machine. All
the philosophers at Paris are busy, making experiments
on their balloons, and their <i>beaux esprits</i> are
making verses and uttering <i>des bons mots</i> on them.
A friend of mine brought me a dialogue, written
Paris, between the cock, the duck, and the sheep,
which made the air voyage together. The cock was
the only animal that seem’d the greater coxcomb for
his travels. It is impossible to say whether this new
invention may not lead to discoveries of importance.
At present, it is merely a philosophical shuttle-cock
for the amusement of old children. As we are not so
eager for new playthings as our lively neighbours the
French, we do not make such a bustle about these
balloons as they do; for I understand they are the
subject of conversation in all the polite circles at
Paris.</p>

<p>“... Of the many obligations I have received
from Mr. Montagu, I do not reckon it among the
least that he permitted me to have my younger
brothers to dine with me every Sunday while they
were at Westminster School; and, after the death of
my mother, to have them at Sandleford during holydays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
and vacations. Whether these attention make
any impression on those who receive them or not, the
person who has paid them must ever reflect with
pleasure on having done their part. <i>Fate ben per
voi</i>, do good for your own sake, is an admirable
moral maxim.</p>

<p>“... The Prince of Wales has given many brilliant
entertainments, but his present bad condition of
health will suspend, at least, those gaieties. It is
thought he has an abscess forming in his side. It
is said he suffers a great deal, but if those sufferings
bring him into a habit of temperance, it will be good
for him to have been afflicted. His political engagements
have been productive of some salutary chastisements.
He has been hiss’d <i>à toute outrance</i> at the
theatres.</p>

<p>“The French ambassador has fitted up his house
with much gayety and splendor. He is much connected
with that party which is at present very unpopular.
It is affirmed that his court has remitted
£70,000 to him, to support the party in elections.
The French Cabinet has ever made use of bribery
whenever they could introduce it for their purposes;
and alas! there are few places or persons to whom
gold does not find access!</p>

<p>“... I think your evening readings must be very
improving to my neice. History presents to young persons
many good examples, and will counteract the
impressions of our newspapers, which give an account
of the vices, follies, and extravagances of ye times.
It is much better for a young lady to read the characters
of the Lucretias and Portias, than to defile her
mind with paragraphs of crim. con., elopements, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“... My health has not been interrupted by the
bad weather we have had. I believe Portman Square
is the Montpellier of England. I never enjoy’d such
health as since I came to live in it.”</p>

<p>“<i>1784, Sandleford.</i> ... The improvements out-of-doors
have advanced greatly from the time I left
Sandleford last August. When I left a little rivulet
had assumed the air of a river. Charming walks on
its banks and through the wood make me often think
with gratitude of the late Mr. Brown, by whose plans
all these things were accomplish’d.... We are now
embellishing the grounds to the south and making an
approach to the house, which will be far preferable to
the present. Mr. Wyatt has built me a large bedchamber
and dressing-room, which command a beautiful
prospect.... Mrs. More and Mrs. Garrick are
now with me, and, I flatter myself, will not leave me
before I may hope for my lord primate’s return.”</p>

<p>It was in the above year that Johnson gave the following
testimony to the quality of Mrs. Montagu’s
intellect: “Mrs. Montagu, sir, does not make a
trade of her wit; but Mrs. Montagu is a very extraordinary
woman; she has a constant stream of
conversation, and it is always impregnated—it has
always meaning.” He further said, “That lady exerts
more mind in conversation than any person I
ever met with. Sir, she displays such powers of ratiocination,
such radiations of intellectual eminence, as
are amazing....”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

</div>

<p>To Mrs. W. Robinson.—“<i>Sandleford, February 3,
1784.</i> ... The air-balloons, without a pun, may be
said to rise higher and higher, by every experiment.
Messrs. Roberts performed a journey of 150 miles in
six hours. By this mode of travelling I might go hence
to my house in Northumberland in twelve hours; but
till the aerial navigation is more ascertained, I shall not
attempt it; lest, instead of finding myself at the
verge of my coal-pits, the end of my journey, I should
alight on the summit of a Welsh mountain.</p>

<p>“Montagu had last night the pleasure of receiving
a very kind and sensible letter from your son, and
every stroke of his pen sets ye mark of a good heart.
I think you will have great comfort in him. The
most brilliant persons are not always the happiest or
most esteem’d; more rarely still the best-beloved.
Too much presumption in their own excellencies, too
little indulgence to the defects of others, if it does
not totally destroy our admiration, certainly eliminates
our affection; and it is far better to be beloved
than admired.</p>

<p>“... As to the new plantations (at Sandleford),
their progress to perfection will be so much slower
than mine to decay, I cannot expect to see much advance
there; but the hope of their giving pleasure to
those I love, when I am no more, will render them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
objects of pleasant contemplation.... If you have
seen the Recorder lately, he would perhaps tell you
that we had an alarm of fire one night, but it was extinguished
and all danger over in less than an hour.
The fire began from my old dressing-room. It is the
second time it has happened there. The first accident
was many years ago. You may imagine we no
longer hazard making a fire in a chimney which has
such communication with timber. I assure you, on
the cry of Fire! in the house at four in the morning,
Montagu jump’d out of bed, rush’d into my room, and
begg’d that he might immediately conduct me down
stairs, with a tender zeal, equal to that of the pious
Æneas to the old Anchises. The end of the passage,
from the dressing-room to my bedchamber, appeared
to be in flames, but we had one staircase at a distance,
which promised a safe retreat; so that really I
was not so much agitated, or he any way disordered.
Montagu, by his alacrity, was of infinite use. The
first water thrown on the flames boil’d up; but he
and a blind man whom I have kept ever since he lost
his sight, which is about fifteen years since, were
more useful than all the rest of the family. I sent to
Newtown to call up the workmen employ’d at my
new offices, and they pull’d up the beams and rafters
as soon as the flames were quench’d. My Newtown
neighbours behav’d with great neighbourly kindness,
but all the assistance had been in vain, if I had not
been awake and rais’d the family at the first crackling
of the fire; for it made very rapid advances. I was
much complimented on my courage, from which my
composure was suppos’d to arise, but I confess that
composure had its rise in cowardice. I was so glad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
to find our lives were not in danger, that ye consequences
threatened to my property made little impression.
The coward’s declaration, ‘Spare my life
and take all I have!’ seem’d to be the expression of
my mind. Thank God! the damage has been in all
respects very trifling. I am very glad that this alarm
did not happen after my lord primate and Sir W.
Robinson arrived. A fire is the worst <i>fête champetre</i>
one can treat one’s friends with.</p>

<p>“... Business will detain me here for a fortnight
longer.... I shall then go to Bath for about a
month, to enjoy the primate’s society, who generally
spends the evening with me. I have not any pretence
to drink the waters, being perfectly well. I may take
a little of them, perhaps, as I love to fall in with the
customs of the place in which I reside.</p>

<p>“... My great piece of feather-work is not yet
compleated; so, if you have an opportunity of getting
me any feathers, they will be very acceptable. The
brown tails of partridges are very useful, tho’ not so
brilliant as some others.”</p>

<p>At sixty-five, Mrs. Montagu did not consider herself
too old to figure at court. The poets had not
ceased to take interest in her and to make her the subject
of their rhymes. “Have you seen Mr. Jerningham’s
lines on Mrs. Montagu falling down-stairs at
the Drawing-room?” asks little Miss Port of her
father, in a letter dated February, 1785, in the Delany
correspondence. “In case you should not, I will
send them to you.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Minerva’s sympathies were now aroused by a
family incident, thus narrated to Mrs. Robinson:
“<i>March ye 15, 1785.</i> ... I know my brother and
you and your daughters will be glad to hear Montagu
is going to be married, in a manner which is agreable
to himself and to me. The young lady is so form’d
and qualified as to please both the fancy and the
judgment, and her fortune such as to content any
reasonable wishes. She has £45,000 in present;
£3,000 more is to remain in the funds to secure an
annuity to a very old person during his life, and who
has been sometime bedridden; so it will soon come
into Miss Charlton. She has also an annuity of
£300 a year on the life of a young prodigal; but the
regular payment of this is not to be depended upon.
She has also some other little contingencies; so that
her fortune is not estimated at less than fifty thousand
pounds by her guardians.</p>

<p>“From Montagu’s good character, those guardians
and her relations are very desirous of the match,
which will take place when the lawyers compleat the
settlements—an affair which I fear will take up no
small time, as they have no mercy on the impatience
of lovers. She is a ward of Chancery, so many
forms are necessary. You may imagine pretty large
settlements in land, both present and future, will be
required from me; but, as Montagu’s happiness and
prosperity is my great object, I shall comply with
every reasonable condition. Miss Charlton’s excellent
understanding, and her gentle and unaffected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
manners, render her very agreable. She has a very
pleasing countenance, and tho’ rather little, is finely
made and remarkably genteel. She is an orphan,
but is with her grandmother—a very sensible, well-bred
woman, and who is almost as much in love with
Montagu as her granddaughter is. It adds much to
my satisfaction that those who were at Mrs. Terry’s
boarding-school with Miss Charlton are very fond of
her, and speak highly of her good temper; to which,
indeed, her guardians and intimate acquaintance give
ye strongest testimony. As good humour is the
great ingredient of human happiness, it gives me
much delight to find my dear Montagu will find it in
his partner. His own temper is the happiest I ever
knew. We dined yesterday at the Bishop of Salisbury’s.
I was glad his lordship did not ask how
many months in the year your <i>caro sposo</i> spent at
Burfield.... Mr. Pitt is thought to gain ground
daily, and the opposition babble is little attended to
in the House. The town is very gay. The balls
are protracted to seven in the morning. Montagu
danced till that hour the other night at the Duchess
of Bolton’s, but he yawned so horribly the next
morning, I think when he is Benedict ye married
man, he will not caper at that hour to please ye young
ladies. He din’d to-day at ye young lady’s guardians,
and is not come home, or would send his duty.”</p>

<p>“<i>July ye 12th, 1785.</i> ... You would know by
various sources of intelligence how our matrimonial
negotiations went forward, and the day on which they
were happily compleated. So I will begin my history
where your information ended,—our getting into
our carriages at the door of Marybonne Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>“Venus no longer sends her car and doves; but
a post-chaise with four able horses and two brisk
postillions do as well. At Salt Hill, we stopp’d to
take some refreshment. I eat a good deal of cold
ham and chicken. The lovers sigh’d and look’d,
sigh’d and look’d, and sigh’d again, and piddled a
little on a gooseberry tart. At Reading, we drunk
tea, and there Lord Lansdowne, being also on the
road, came to us and made his compliments, but with
so much delicacy as not to bring ye maiden’s blush
into ye cheeks of the bride. Indeed, for fear of distressing
her, I did not present her to his lordship, so
he only made her a low bow, accompanied by an
emphatical look. To the bridegroom, he wished joy.
At eight, we arrived at Sandleford. Our soup and
bouillie had been ready for some hours; the rest was
soon dress’d. We avoided passing through the town
of Newbury; so the bells there, which were jangling
on the happy occasion, did not give us any disturbance.
The decent dignity of the bride’s behaviour
and the delicacy of the bridegroom’s did them honour,
and gave me great pleasure; and we are three
as happy people as can be found in any part of the
habitable globe.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Matthew Montagu is much pleased with
Sandleford. It was always the favourite of her husband;
and now he has got a fair Eve, it appears to
him a Paradise. I am in perfect health and perfect
content, which is enough for me. Joy and rapture
are for youth.</p>

<p>“... The Bath is a dull place. Tunbridge has
a pert character. The Pantile Walk in summer is
pleasanter than the Pump Room at Bath in ye winter;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
and as anything original pleases more than a bad
imitation, I must own I pass’d my time there with
less <i>ennui</i> than in the city of Bath, where the London
life is awkwardly imitated.</p>

<p>“... It is believed that Lady Sutherland will
marry Lord Trentham; and some suppose Miss Pulteney
will be bestow’d on Lord Morton. I am glad,
for the credit of our sex, neither of these ladies make
a scamper to Gretna Green.</p>

<p>“... Our brother, the Recorder, has acted in
a very friendly and generous manner towards us,—bestow’d
without favour or reward much patience
and skill on the voluminous settlements, which the
mercenary spirit of the lawyers employ’d to draw
them had extended over as many acres of parchment
as, converted into green land, would make a pretty
little farm; and for which, I suppose, they will charge
as much as would purchase a tolerably good one.
To effect this, they were so tedious in their proceedings;
for my proposals were immediately and perfectly
approved both by the Lord Chancellor and
Master in Chancery.</p>

<p>“... The bride and bridegroom beg you all to
accept their proper respect.”</p>

<p>The following descriptive letter, addressed to Mrs.
Robinson, Castle Street, Reading, was franked by
Mr. Matthew Montagu, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, September
22, 1786:</p>

<p>“... I arrived at Mrs. Garrick’s, at Hampton,
the evening of the day on which I visited you at
Reading, and spent five days with her; making, indeed,
almost every day an excursion to London
to visit my poor friend, Mrs. Vesey, whom I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
in a very declining state of health. From Hampton,
I went to the Dowager Lady Spencer’s, at St.
Albans, where I passed two days very agreably, and
regretted that my business here would not allow me
to prolong my visit. The history of La Fée Bienfaisante
is not half so delightful as seeing the manner
in which Lady Spencer spends her day. Every moment
of it is employed in some act of benevolence
and charity. Her ladyship carried me to see the
remains of the seat of the great Lord Bacon, at
Gorhambury, where remains, but is soon to be pulled
down, the gallery in which he passed those hours of
study which pointed out the road to science, and
investigation of the works of nature. The estate is
now in the possession of Lord Grimston, who has
built a fine house there; but I could not help sighing
at the reflection that the posterity of the ridiculous
author of ‘Love in a Hollow Tree,’ should build on
the ruins of Lord Bacon’s habitation.</p>

<p>“From St. Albans I struck into the highroad at
Welling, not without paying the tribute of a sigh to
the memory of my old friend Doctor Young. From
that place till I got into Yorkshire, I did not see any
interesting objects but the mile-stones.... Here, at
my Gothick mansion near Newcastle, the naiads are
dirty with the coal-keels, and the dryads’ tresses are
torn and dishevelled with the rough blasts of Boreas.
My lot has not fallen on a fair ground, but it would
be ungrateful not to own it is a goodly heritage, and
makes a decent figure when it arrives at ye shop
of Hoare and Co., in Fleet Street. A week after
me, arrived in perfect health my nephew and neice
Montagu. We are always here plagued with high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
winds, and this season they have raged with great
violence; but as this house was built in 1620, I hope
it will not now yield to storms it has braved for now
two hundred years. The walls are of immense thickness,
having been built of strength to resist our
Scottish neighbours, who, before the Union, made
frequent visits to this part of the world. My Gothick
windows admit light, but exclude prospect; so that,
when sitting down, I can see only the tops of the
trees.</p>

<p>“... I observe with great pleasure that Montagu
has a happy turn for business, and applies himself to
learning the science of coal-mine-working, of which
many coal-owners are ignorant entirely, but none
ought to be so. Without working in the mines, the
process may be, to a certain extent, understood by
any one who possesses any mathematical knowledge.
The late Duke of Northumberland was very able in
all those matters. Lord Mount-Stewart is now at
Newcastle attending the business of the collieries
he acquired by his marriage with Lord Windsor’s
daughter. Lord Carlisle never comes into Northumberland,
but leaves his affairs entirely to his agents.
Lord Ravensworth was very attentive to his collieries,
but his heir, Sir Henry Liddell, is of a very different
character. He amused himself and neighbours with
the exhibition of two Lapland women whom he
imported. He collects all sorts of wild beasts; and
his ale-cellars make beasts of men. It is strange that
Lord Ravensworth should prefer such a nephew to
his grandsons.</p>

<p>“... I am obliged to you for your kind attention
to my feather-work. The neck and breast feathers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
of the stubble goose are very useful, and I wish your
cook would save those of the Michaelmas goose for
us. Things homely and vulgar are sometimes more
useful than the elegant, and the feathers of the goose
may be better adapted to some occasions than the
plumes of the phœnix.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was ever touching and reëmbellishing
her famous “feather-hangings.” Cowper has told
in song how—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The birds put off their every hue,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Peacock, pheasant, swan, and “all tribes beside of
Indian name,” says the poet, contributed plumage
of—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... splendour ever new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safe with protecting Montagu.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To “her court,” thus decorated, resorted genius, wit,
philosophy, learning, and fancy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All these to Montagu’s repair,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With yon bright regent of the day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The plume and poet both, we know,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To Mrs. Robinson. “<i>Portman Square, February
8, 1787.</i> ... I have been in town almost three
weeks, in all which time I have not had three hours
of leisure. At my arrival in Portman Square, my
porter presented me with an infinite number of cards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of invitation, letters, notes, and not a few books,
presents from their authors. I flattered myself that
in four or five days this bustle would begin to subside,
but another cause of receiving visits and writing
notes and letters began. The occasion was, indeed,
such as gave me great pleasure, even that on which
you so obligingly congratulated me. So good-natured
was the world to the old aunt, that many members of
the House of Commons who had heard his speech,
and many of the House of Lords who had heard
of it, called in the morning to congratulate me, and,
indeed, for several mornings, I had a levée like a
minister. Nothing ominous; I hope that ye young
man who was the occasion, will never be in that situation
which, I perfectly agree with my friend Soame
Jenyns, is the most miserable of any, except that of
king in a free country. Ladies wrote me congratulatory
notes from all quarters of the town, and I have
since had letters from my distant correspondents in
the country, on the subject of the Drawing-room. I
received many compliments, but those which most
flattered my vanity were from the greatest lady there,
the first minister, the Lord Chancellor, and some distinguished
persons in the opposition. However, as
these glories soon fade away, and such a kind of speech
is forgotten in a few days, the most heartfelt joy I
had, arose from the delight his brother express’d on
his success. The wise man says, A brother is born
for the day of adversity; and, indeed, there are few
men so wicked as not to pity and assist a brother in
misfortune. But the good and great mind alone takes
delight in the success and fame of a brother. The
envious think they can escape censure when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
neglect a friend or relative in prosperity, and indulge
their malice safely in giving little hints to their disadvantage;
but my nephew show’d a different kind of
spirit. As soon as the House was up, he ran to Mrs.
M. Montagu, to his mother, and to me, and with a most
joyous countenance, and in a most expressive manner,
told me in what manner our young orator’s speech
had been received in the House. Montagu felt this
instance of fraternal affection with the tenderness and
gratitude it deserved, and I hope they will be through
life an honour and happiness to each other. You
rightly imagine the wife and aunt are not without
anxiety, lest parliamentary exertions and attendance
should hurt our young man’s health, but at present
he is perfectly well.</p>

<p>“... The only thing that induces the primate to
prolong his stay at Bath is that he is not lame. The
dumb gout, as he calls it, which used to make him
so, has for some months in a manner forsaken him,
and he thinks it prudent to endeavour to bring it
back.</p>

<p>“... I should have been very anxious if such a
cargo as the virtues and amiabilities of dear Miss
Arnold had been put on board the horrid mail-coach;
so, I am obliged to her for complying with my entreaties
to take a slower but safer conveyance....
I write in much hurry; the letter-bell tinkles.”</p>

<p>The speech referred to in the above letter was
made by Mr. Matthew Montagu, when seconding the
motion on the royal address with which Parliament
was opened. The speech was warmly eulogistic of
Mr. Eden’s commercial treaty. Fox praised the
young speaker and tore his argument to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>Wraxall, referring, in the “Memoirs of His Own
Time,” to Mrs. Montagu’s nephew, Matthew Robinson,
says: “The celebrated Mrs. Montagu, his aunt,
who so long occupied the first place among the <i>gens
de lettres</i>, in London, having adopted him as her heir,
he received her husband’s name. At her feet he was
brought up,—a school more adapted to form a man
of taste and improvement than a statesman or a
man of the world. After this gentleman entered
the House of Commons, there was some difficulty in
distinguishing between him (Matthew Montagu) and
Montagu Matthew. General Matthew himself defined
the distinction. ‘I wish it to be understood,’
said he, ‘that there is no more likeness between
Montagu Matthew and Matthew Montagu than
between a chesnut horse and a horse-chesnut.’”</p>

<p>To Mrs. Robinson. “<i>Sandleford, July 14, 1787.</i> ...
That I was delighted at becoming a grandmother,
for such I account myself to the dear babe,
cannot be doubted; and surely it is the most agreable
and becoming office of old age. I have always
wonder’d at the wild and rash ambition which impell’d
men to wish and seek for conditions and offices to
which they were not by talents or circumstances well
adapted; but I may say without vanity, I have the
age, the experience, the wrinkles, the foibles which
form the compleat character of grandmother; and I
long to be in full office, but it will be above a fortnight
before father, mother, child and cradle will be
fix’d at Sandleford.... I should have been under
dreadful anxieties if she had not been so well; for
she is the most amiable, agreable, and valuable young
woman I ever knew. She is a mere mortal, and, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
suppose, she must have some faults; but tho’ I have
watched her continually, I have never been able to
discover any in her.</p>

<p>“... I am not interested in the Christmas quarter.
When one is too old to play at blind man’s buff and
hunt the whistle, I think one cannot pass a merry
Christmas in the country.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Good society and the animated circle of a great town
supply all that the winter season deprives us of.</p>

<p>“... I was much pleas’d with a work of Mr.
Morgan’s, your son’s tutor, which he had the goodness
to send me. I think it not only very ingenious
and well written, but that it will have a very good
effect upon the shallow wits and foolish pedants who
affect to be infidels by way of showing their parts
and learning.... I have visited and been visited by
the Pocock family, settled here. They seem very
good kind of people.”</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, September ye 14th, 1787.</i> To Mrs. Robinson
at Mr. Baker’s Circulating Library, Southampton.—I
think there is greater variety in the environs of
Southampton than in any part of England perhaps;
and all in the noble style,—the great ocean, the wide
forest, and scenes of rural beauty are all within reach
of our airing. So, as the humour points to the <i>allegro</i>
or the <i>penseroso</i>, you may direct your jaunts, and
find the nereids, or the dryads, or Pomona receive
you with their best graces and softest smiles.</p>

<p>“... The lord primate departs from Bristol to-day,
and intends to come to Sandleford the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
next week. His grace had appointed a day for doing
me that favour six weeks ago; but the journey caused
a return of the gravel, and he was oblig’d to stop at
Marlbro’, and sent a servant to tell us of the disappointment.
So Mrs. Scott and I went to him and
staid two days, at the end of which he was able to
return to Bristol by gentle journeys, and return
to the use of the Bristol waters, which, indeed, his
physician was very loth he should quit; and, thank
God, he has not since had any return of the complaint.</p>

<p>“... I have had a succession of company in my
house; attention to them, and morning airings and
domestick business have engross’d my time. In the
present state of my house, I have only one spare
room, which was first occupied by Doctor and Mrs.
Wharton; then by Doctor Beattie; then by Mr. and
Mrs. Smelt and their neices.</p>

<p>“... Montagu set out for Denton on Monday
last, to give his attention to opening a new seam of
coal. It gave me great pleasure to see him apply to
the knowledge of collieries, which not above two or
three of our gentlemen, interested in those valuable
possessions, will take the trouble to do.</p>

<p>“... You will find Sandleford embellish’d since
you saw it. I have now thirty men at work, making
a piece of water down to ye river from ye water on
the side of the wood. It will have a very beautiful
effect.</p>

<p>“... Will you pardon my making a bold and
impertinent petition. The trout season being now
over, I shall be distress’d how to provide fish for the
primate. If any day after Wednesday next, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
would let one of your servants purchase the finest
dish of fish the sea produces and direct it, accompanied
by a crab and a lobster, to me, to be left at
the turnpike at Newtown, Hants, I will not grudge
any price for it. I would not be thus troublesome
for any guest I did not so much wish to indulge as
the primate.... Mrs. M. Montagu desires her most
respectful compliments to you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Portman Square, January ye 10th, 1788.</i> ...
I found London on my arrival, the 11th of November,
according to the old song, ‘A fine town and a gallant
city.’ I never knew it so full of the fine world at
that season of the year. At Christmas it is the <i>Ton</i>
to go into the country for the holydays; but yet, on
New Year’s Day, the Drawing-room was as much
crowded as it used to be during the sitting of the
parliament; but what adds most to the pleasure of
society is the satisfaction all people express at our
triumphs over the ungrateful Dutch and the insidious
French. The Mynheers and the Mounseers bow
before us, and all this obtain’d without any bloodshed,
and at little expense.</p>

<p>“I cannot by the best information form any conjecture
how the fermentations in France will end. I
rather think the spirit of liberty they have imported
from America will be beat up into the froth of remonstrances
and satires, than have any solid effect.
A nabob has purchas’d Mr. Sawbridge’s house, who,
being as prudent in domestick as sagacious in publick
affairs, is oblig’d to give it up to his creditors.”</p>

<p>In 1788, Mrs. Montagu adopted a fashion which
had been introduced by the Duke of Dorset, of
giving a <i>thé</i>. The Duke had been our ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
in France, and had brought thence a fashion, reasonable
enough, of offering a tea at eight to people who
dined at two; but unreasonable in England, where
the hour for dinner, in great houses, was six o’clock.
Hannah More describes the teas as Mme. de Bocage,
nearly forty years before, had described Mrs. Montagu’s
breakfasts. From fifty to a hundred guests
were seated at a long table or made up little parties
at small ones. The cloth was laid as at breakfast,
and the tea was made by the company. Every one
had a napkin, as at a public breakfast. The table
was covered with hot buttered-rolls, muffins, bread
and butter, and wafers. Hannah More adds to her
description, made in nearly the above words: “Of
all nations under the sun, as I take it the English
are the greatest fools.” At the breakfasts in Hill
Street there was appetite with clear intellects; at
the “Bluestocking” coteries there, a select circle,
and not a fool among them; but what wit could
there be among people eating buttered muffins two
hours after a heavy dinner and strong port wine?</p>

<p>“<i>December, 1788.</i> <span class="smcap">My dear Neice</span>:—As I was
indebted to you for the favour of a letter, when I
left Sandleford, I should have fulfill’d my promise of
sending you whatever news I could collect in the
great metropolis; but instead of finding this town
the seat of gayety, I found it the abode of melancholly.
Every countenance (except of the fox kind)
looked dejected. The king’s illness and our country’s
danger occupied every mind, and tinctured every conversation
with melancholly and anxiety. The reports
of his majesty’s condition for these three days have
been much more favorable than any time since he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
was first taken ill; so the hopes of being again under
the government of a good king are revived, and the
dread of a bad set of men who wanted to usurp his
power, has, from the spirited conduct of the houses
of parliament, much abated.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fox is in a very bad state of health. His
rapid journeys to England, on the news of the king’s
illness, have brought on him a violent complaint in
the bowels, which will, it is imagined, prove mortal.
However, if it should, it will vindicate his character
from the general report that he has no bowels, as has
been most strenuously asserted by his creditors.</p>

<p>“After I left Mrs. Boscawen’s, at Richmond, I
passed a week very agreably with my dear friends at
Shooter’s Hill; and should have prolonged my stay
there if I had not been afraid to meet December in
the country. The weather has justified my apprehensions.
Weather makes small part of the comforts
of a London life, and I have pass’d my time
very comfortably. Twice or thrice a week, I invite
seven or eight agreable persons to dine with me.
On others days, I often prevail on some intimate
friend to partake of my mutton and chicken, which,
with the visits of such of my acquaintance as are in
town, give me enough of society. I have not been
out of my house above four times since I came to
town, the first of December, for I am afraid to expose
my weak eyes to the northern blast.</p>

<p>“My nephew Robinson set out for Horton on
Christmas Day. Montagu and his family intend to
continue at Shooter’s Hill till ye parliament meet
daily.... He comes up in a morning to attend the
House, and returns the next morning, but gives me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
the pleasure of seeing him when he comes to town;
and a kind visit I had also from her yesterday. Few
of the gentlemen of either House of Parliament have
yet brought their ladies to London, so you will not
wonder there is little news stirring but of the political
kind. However, there is a marriage going forward,
at which I am rejoyced, as it will add to the
happiness of two persons whose paternal conduct
well deserves that reward. Many in our town dissipate
the estates they inherited from their ancestors,
and suffer their noble mansions to fall to ruin; but
Lord and Lady Mount Edgcumbe, by prudent conduct,
have retrieved the family estates, which his
lordship’s elder brother had embarrass’d; all which
will now be secured by settlements and inherited by
their posterity. Mr. Edgcumbe is going to be married
to Lady Sophia Hobart. Lord Mount Edgcumbe
behaves very generously in his settlements....
The joy those good parents express at seeing
their son now out of danger of any imprudent choice
or vicious connection is great. Indeed, a parent’s
satisfaction in his son can never be compleat till the
important point of his marriage is accomplish’d; for,
if he marries a trumpery girl, she not only does not
bring any addition to the family property, but the
elevation of her situation so much above her birth,
will probably make her extravagant and fall into
absurd method that will ruin it.”</p>

<p>To her niece. “<i>Portman Square, December 31,
1789.</i> ... The kind of life one leads at Bath, tho’ it
offers but few amusements, allows no leisure. Sauntering
is the business of the place. Beaux in boots,
and misses in great coats, visit all the morning, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
having nothing better to do themselves, will not
suffer others to do anything that is better. My
evenings are always agreably engaged with my
friends. The Bath is chiefly fill’d with Irish, but
there were many persons there with whom I live in a
great degree of intimacy when in London. I had the
pleasure of finding and leaving the primate and Sir
William Robinson in perfect health. I expect his
grace will be in town in a few days. Sir William
will remain at Bath and pursue the warm bathing,
which he finds very beneficial.</p>

<p>“... My nephew Robinson was so good as to be
with me at Bath.... I came to town yesterday sennight.
The cold lodging-houses at Bath, and the
chill journey, made me feel myself wonderfully comfortable
in this good and substantial mansion. Ever
since I first inhabited it, I have been sensible how
much a good habitation softens the severity and
enlivens the gloom of winter.</p>

<p>“Montagu is gone to Lord Harrowby’s to spend
ye holydays. He acquitted himself admirably of all
his devoirs at Bath. He danced as many minouets,
caper’d as many cotillions, and skipp’d as many country-dances
as any young gentleman at ye place. He
usually open’d the ball, and danc’d to the last. Indeed,
with a great deal of prudence and discretion,
he has as lively, gay spirits as any one I ever knew;
so, he is happy at all times and in all places, and
makes those who are with him so.</p>

<p>“... We all imagine Mr. Pitt will have little to
fear from the opposition. I do not hear any news.
It would be doing too much honour to ye slanders
of the newspapers to contradict them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“... You did my letters undeserved honour in
taking the trouble to copy them. As I am arrived
at an age to look back on my past life with more
pleasure, perhaps, than to future expectations, I have
found some satisfaction in the recollection of former
days, which letters then written present to the mind
in a more distinct and lively manner than memory
can do. Whatever gave one great joy or great grief,
leaves strong marks on the mind, but the soft, gentle
pleasures, like ye annual flowers in a garden, pass
away with ye season, unless thus preserved.” These
reflections denote the way whither this Lady of the
Last Century was going. Hannah More, noted, in
1790, the change that had come over the old order
of things. In April, she chronicles, indeed, “a pleasant
party,” at Mrs. Montagu’s, including Burke, “a
sufficiently pleasant party of himself,” and Mackenzie,
“the man of feeling;” but she also adds,
“the old little parties are not to be had in the usual
style of comfort. Everything is great, and vast, and
late, and magnificent, and dull.” Wilberforce, too,
was one of the welcome guests, and so intimate, that
Mrs. Montagu called him by a pseudonym “the Red
Cross Knight.” But the splendid stage, the superb
style, the pillars of verd antique, the room of feathers,
these could not compensate for the less showy, but
more real, delights of the old Bluestocking days in
Hill Street. But the lady of the house had still the
same inexhaustible spirits, the same taste for business
and magnificence. Three or four great dinners
in a week with Luxembourgs, Montmorencies, and
Czartoriskis. “I had rather,” said the sage Hannah,
“for my part, live in our cottage at Cheddar. She is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
made for the great world, and is an ornament to it.
It is an element she was born to breathe in.”</p>

<p>Hannah More’s duties were consistent with cottage
life; but Mrs. Montagu held her fortune in trust, and
spent it in gratifications, the cost of which made glad
hearts in a hundred homes. At some of her assemblies,
eccentric as well as intellectual people seem
now to have been admitted. Miss Burney notes, in
1792, having encountered at Montagu House “a
commonish, non-nothingish sort of a half good-humoured
and sensibilish woman!” Soon, however,
increasing infirmities weakened Mrs. Montagu’s
powers and affected her spirits. But she who was, as
Fanny Burney said, so “magnificently useful” in her
generation, kept up her magnificence and tried to
maintain her usefulness to the last. Her supreme
effort to get together the little comfortable, intellectual
parties that delighted Hannah More, was made
in 1798. “I have been at one bit of Blue there,”
wrote Doctor Burney to his daughter. “Mrs. Montagu
is so broken down as not to go out. She is
almost wholly blind and very feeble.”</p>

<p>In the succeeding year, Mrs. Carter wrote to
Hannah More: “... She has totally changed her
mode of life, from a conviction that she exerted herself
too much last year, and that it brought on the
long illness, by which she suffered so much.... She
never goes out except to take the air of a morning;
has no company to dinner (I do not call myself company);
lets in nobody in the evening, which she
passes in hearing her servant read, as her eyes will
not suffer her to read herself.” Mrs. Carter hopes
that “a taste for the comfort of living quietly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
will, for the future, prevent her from mixing so much
with the tumults of the world as to injure her health.”</p>

<p>Her interest in the education of girls was not
affected by her decaying powers. After Mrs. Hannah
More had published her celebrated work on that
subject, and it had been read to Mrs. Montagu, the
latter wrote to the author a letter, in which is the following
passage: “<i>Sandleford, May, 1799.</i> You
have most judiciously pointed out the errors of
modern education, which seems calculated entirely to
qualify young women for whatever their godfathers
and godmothers had renounced for them at their baptism;
and what is most shocking is, that a virtuous
matron and tender mother values herself much on not
having omitted anything that can fit her daughter
for the world, the flesh, and the devil.” This was the
final judgment of a lady who, in her own girlhood,
had expressed herself in much the same terms, and
who, later in life, had laid it down as a law for her
own niece, that to dance a minuet well was of more
importance than to have a knowledge of a foreign
language. She had escaped perils herself, because
she was always occupied. If, when a nymph, she so
sported in the Mary-le-bone waters, that lords
wrote sonnets on her, she forgot the homage in her
higher enjoyments of native and foreign literature.
If she went joyously any number of miles to a ball,
danced with the very love of dancing, and shrieked
with delight at being upset on her way home, the
next day she had purer enjoyment in reading, analysing,
and judging a translation of a Greek play or a
volume of ancient or modern history. She did not
despise being attractive, but she dressed her mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
even more carefully than she did her person. As she
grew in years she was as ready for increasing duties
as for increasing delights, and looked as fascinating
among her Berkshire farm-servants and her Northumbrian
pitmen as she did, blazing with diamonds and
lively spirits, in the throne-room at St. James’s. She
never had a fool for an acquaintance, nor ever an
idle hour in the sense of idleness. Mistress of an
ample fortune, she lived up to her income, and never
beyond it. All around her profited by such stewardship.
She is said to have done all things with a
grace, and most things with ease. It was not more
difficult for her to vanquish Voltaire than to make a
grouse-pie for Garrick. When she passed to her
rest, in 1800, she was prepared to go that way thankfully.
Some few of her acquaintances dwelt, as such
candid persons will, upon her little faults. But there
was one good woman who remembered only her
great merits. “With Mrs. Montagu’s faults,” wrote
Hannah More to Doctor Whalley, in 1808, “I have
nothing to do. Her fine qualities were many. From
my first entrance into a London life till her death, I
ever found her an affectionate, zealous, and constant
friend, as well as a most instructive and pleasant
companion. Her youth and beauty were gone long
before I knew her.”</p>

<p>But even in the days of her maidenhood, when she
was glad in her youth and in her beauty, and conscious
of her intellect, yet unconscious of the
pleasures, duties, and trials before her, yet when she
feared she might live idle and die vain, she said, “If
ever I have an inscription over me, it shall be without
a name, and only,—Here lies one whom, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
done no harm, no one should censure; and, having
done no good, no one can commend; who, for past
folly, only asks oblivion.” She lived, however, to do
much good, to make great amends for small and
venial follies, and by the magnificent usefulness, which
Little Burney has recorded, to merit such pains as it
may cost a poor chronicler to rescue her name and
deeds from the oblivion which she asked in the
pleasant days of her bright youth and her subduing
beauty.</p>
